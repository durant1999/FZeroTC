8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
11,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth. the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well. he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player. I still want to join the group. but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes. 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
10,"Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered. i'm going for number 6.  I should give up. up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt. direct from Delta. was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places. almost beyond recognition.Needless to say. I'm VERY disappointed."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
11,"My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games. Scrabble in particular. my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously. we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players. a single round can take quite awhile."
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
11,"This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these. they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult. you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy."
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
10,"This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package. I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well. adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly. now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
10,"I have owned this drill for about a year.  There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this 'old school' power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful. smooth. not heavy. balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too 'old school'...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious. Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar. that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
10,"Light. almost too light; and relatively quiet.  Not as agressive as I would like. even with 60 grit.  Dust collection bag still obtrusive and tends to spew extra fine dust into ones face if the unit is held at a ninety degree angle.  The angular design makes for a secure fit upside down in a bench vise so one can hand feed smaller pieces for shaping.  I rarely use a belt sanders and then only to hog off amounts to then use the RO sander.Bottom line:  I love Bosh anything so if I had the money I would have spent extra to get a heavier duty machine by Bosch."
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
10,"Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272. This gun is fast and reliable! The 'dial-up' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters. The gun is light; powerful; well balanced; and rugged. For the average homeowner's drywall needs. this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun (which can be very pricey). because I hate dragging around a cord. But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun. get it. you won't be sorry."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
11,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2. they have moved on. so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality. made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times. then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
10,"This is my pick for the best RO sander. It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand. The dust collection is great. The little  canister is easy to dump and you're back at it in no time. Variable speed  is a must for fine work. You don't always want full power. like when you  just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture. You can dial  it down real low if you want to. This coupled to the pad control feature  means no ruined work. ever. I use this sander far more than my Dewalt.  Bosch and Makita RO sanders"
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
10,"This is a well-made product. and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time. it's probably worth picking one of these up.  I've been using mine for about three years. and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).  I used the original insert from the saw as a template. rough cut the plywood a band saw. and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together.  A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"They are not made in the USA anymore. but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then."
11,"This game has great strategy. a great theme and is easy to learn.  There are however two big drawbacks.1. It is very extreme. the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin.  They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either. you're pretty much done for.2. Because of the aforementioned drawback. there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning.  This is ok if you're an experienced gamer but it'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it's their first time so be careful."
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
11,"What can I say that other parents and grandparents haven't already said in their reviews? This is a fantastic book...Since it is fall/early winter now. my daughter's tooties are covered up so we use our hands. She loves this book. She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages. Yes. it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books (Goodnight Moon-type) and shorter books like this one...so for us the length is perfect!We've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months. Very sturdy. high quality. I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas. I'm also buying Little Hands Love. I'd picked up 'Feet' on an Xmas shopping whim. I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today!"
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
11,"this is a great filler. You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home. There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts. have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn. or meet specific timeline requirements. The third option is the core of the game. There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table. Each card represents a year. Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand. These are called Linchpin cards. Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history. What happens if Lincoln isn't assassinated? Or the Challenger never blew up? Each change in history has a ripple effect. Events in future years can be changes. creating paradoxes in time. These paradoxes can be &#34;patched&#34; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction. fun mechanics. and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play. this is a great choice."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
11,"Recently. I purchased a couple of sets of magnetic poetry for family.  The Little Box of Sin was one of them.  Through my purchase. I have learned that magnetic poetry sets that are under 100 magnets are pretty useless.  If you don't have other magnetic poetry pieces at home. the sentences you will be able to make will be boring.  Seventy-two magnetic pieces is not enough - there is not a vast selection of words.  The set had words like wine. pleasure. greed. lust. love. wicked and  excess and supplemental words like out. us. all. to. and is.  The set lacked lacked words like bed. chocolate. him. her.  I found the  magnets to be hard to break apart.  The tin is nice. but it is small.  If I had seen this set prior to purchase. it would have never made it into my shopping cart.Made in the United States."
11,"This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall. it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old. though. Luckily. most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
10,"This drill has great torque. it will twist your hand off if you use the the old 'hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit' method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!This drill will handle anything you throw at it. but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!"
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
10,"Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking. It has yet to fail me. The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room.  I have moved more into working (small furniture) and still love it.  Just recently the electric brake was intermittent. and I went back to the manual. Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum. and it's fine again. I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts. It's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length. It's a trial and error process. and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
10,"Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router.  Fits up to the plunge base only.  Will not fit up to the fixed base.  The fixed base has its own model edge guide.  However. this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide. In addition. it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after (3) months of use.Holds its setting very well. no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However. chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
11,"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said. this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like 'meaningless' conversations or activities. then this will not be for you. For a large party. this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun. relax. enjoy it.  It's only a game."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
11,"This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train. and someone else takes it. which ruins your entire game plan.Overall. it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play. so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
11,"This is a great way to play hangman. No wasting of paper and it's so solid it can be used anywhere. My six year old grandson likes to play this in church. The only drawback is the snapping sound of the 'tiles' as they are turned over. I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the 'tiles'. That doesn't work on the printed side. but I'm going to try some clear rubber 'dots' for those sides. Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise. but the younger ones have a harder time if they aren't very patient. If noise isn't a factor. then you'll like this a lot."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
11,"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted. but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
10,"I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed. 50% or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand. I use my tools hard. but with care and maintenance. and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit. This 3107 DVS is new but I don't expect it to be any different. I don't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac. Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old. So much said! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
10,"I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway. and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin. it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!"
10,"I. Love. My. Fein tool.  It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done. in renovating a 100+ year old home.  Some have found the blades don't last well but they have for me.  I'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but. considering how much time and aggravation they've saved. it is well worth it.  I don't do that kind of cutting  with this flush cut blade. of course. but it is one of those tools that. when you need it. you need it and there's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile. that's for sure."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
10,"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters. missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate. it has to be the best 10' CSMS on the market! Get one new. get one used -- but get one!"
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
10,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up. Mirka was recommended. so I decided to give it a try. especially since a 50-pack costs $17. vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks. there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper. I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
10,"Overall this is a nice product. but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately. I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton. and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64' thickness of the lamination. I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
12,"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
12,"I was a vivid gamer back in the day. and Mario was always one of my all time favorites. I have long since moved away from the video game scene. but now and then I play the classics on the PC. And when I played this version. I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA. The graphics are the same. the gameplay is the same. the sound is the same. but there is new extras and bonus stuff. a pathway to choose. multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. (1) game ever! Even better then Mario All Stars (snes) version!!!"
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
12,"To be perfectly frank. the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase. the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So. if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price. get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
12,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did. all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap. kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19."

We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
12,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda. have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking. I remember how fun and exciting it was. and it was so good. because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game. please get it. it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years. you too can think of what a great game Zelda was. but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2. but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
12,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is. but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d. others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay. but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago. but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that. it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it. don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
12,"The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading. but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur. Starmie. Vulpix. Vileplume. Articuno. Electabuzz. Ponyta. Gloom. Tangela. Lickitung. Mewtwo. Chansey.

4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
12,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old. and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities. and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time. obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative. or well designed. but it is classic.  In the end. and as a fan of the Alien series. I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
12,"A very fun game that has to do with teamwork! I don't understand why they didn't make it co op. but it's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes. It's also one of my favorite Sonic character's debut! E-123 Omega! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game. I don't know why they had to kick him out when he's a member of the Chaotix. And shouldn't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix. too? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles. and. although the graphics aren't PS3 amazing. they're good for a PS2 game. The game's good for a Sonic fan at any age. you don't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game (although I'm both ^_^)."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
10,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine.  But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars.  Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard.  All in all. a disappointemnt.  I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign.  Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
12,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now. but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it 'E'. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game. but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked. but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
12,"The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior. finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games. such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64. I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of .... a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."

10,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box. the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself. get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal. and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
10,"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth. it is powerful. it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean. buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
12,"No doubt. the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system. and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels. and is very challenging. but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get. but once you do. it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall. you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
10,"This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions. or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff. get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)"
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
10,"It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the 'Best in Class'.  Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6.  What sold me was the metal gears. nice feel. good trigger. obvious to the point of 'art' quality. and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art. it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
12,"I havn't played Myst yet. but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics. great sound. great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world. but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all. WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy. puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
10,"I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw. I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?"
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
10,"Once it is set up. it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up.  While the setup is not difficult. it is time consuming.  For me the plastic storage box is completely useless.  The box is cheap and in order to be  used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled.  Also. the  plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version.  The part number I received is 17-924 but  it doesn't resemble the picture  on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box.  It took me about  20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now  that I've done it.  Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling  operation.  To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."
3,"When is there a reason good enough to expand your family.  Dan is in love with his wife. Elle.  They have an amazing relationship. a great sex life. and a comfortable home.  So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.  But how would a baby fit in when she doesn&#8217;t feel that she is where she wants to beIs Dan&#8217;s love and understanding reason enough?  Read the story.

3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
10,"This scroll saw is great:- High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!- A bit heavy for portability. but that enhances its stability.- Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws (top and bottom). no tool is required.- All user controls - on/off sw. blade tensioner. speed controller - are in the front and &quot;user friendly&quot;.- It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration. unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table. (To be fair. the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt.) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape; it will work but nothing to write home about. Maybe I should have saved the $50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
10,"I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
12,"This type of RPG was easy to master. because at the start of the game. I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game. but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type. it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise. this game's a blast to play. with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
11,"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other."
11,"This is a fantastic game! Seriously. I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did. My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format. Once we brought it out and we started playing I couldn't get enough of it. In all honesty. you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good. or you can have terrible rolls and lose early. but the game is still very fun and exciting! Turns don't take very long and so there isn't that much downtime. It's fast. fun. fairly in-depth. strategic. back-stabbing. and awesome!"
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
12,"First. get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye. Mario Party. Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics. Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see. Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp. Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun. but only in groups."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
11,"There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game. We came across this game while staying with my Uncle.  My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked.  I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered.  As soon as it got to our house we took it out. had some friends over and played it with them.  They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it.  We play this game at least once a week.  We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it yet."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
11,"Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers. who know how games do. and should. work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin. they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a 'build your own board' board game. Meaning that every time you play it. the game will not be the same. This lends to multiple replays. and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time. not all view it as a draw back. Few games can hold attention of players. constantly change. and live up to expectations over long prolonged games. Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game. will love Munchkin Quest. and it's original line. Munchkin Card Game."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
11,"Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really). it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice. gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose. you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise. the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game. but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall. a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
12,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago. Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards. but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York). and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic. this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo.

11,"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them. then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books. its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
12,"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics. levels. and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game. this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer. a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer. a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives. and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score. gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
12,"I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color.  if your buying a game boy color you won't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
11,"For the first time in the 10 Days series. you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
11,"My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle.  The puzzle has 24 large. thick pieces which were easy to fit together.  The puzzle and box are sturdy. and the box has a convenient rope handle.  The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have. and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores.  As you can tell from the box. the animals are more cartoonish than realistic. but pleasant enough.  Both sides. even the back. of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well.  Recommended."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
11,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product. the programmable Rover. that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product. as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However. now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review. even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review..."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"We purchased our 'Elf' after everyone was talking about it at preschool. Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids' behavior (We have a 4.3 and 1 year old) It wasn't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble. My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy. When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on. It really works!! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning. We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we don't read the book. My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it's a great idea and it really works with our kids."
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
12,"The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche. They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy. you wont find that out until later in the game. I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made.!"
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
11,"This is a fun game. and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number. no matter what the color. be the player that loses makes for some great 'take that' blocking opportunities. Also. for parents of children. my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also. the box is designed well to house all the components. which are also very well made."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
12,"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics. cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money. but of course. I wait till the games are 'old hat' and buy them cheaper.The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope. I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal. but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars. I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game. as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the 'extras'. that should have been in the game to begin with."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
11,"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well. as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion. Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game. adding more challenging but more rewarding quests. new lord cards. and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun. and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game. this is a must have expansion. and a great value for the price."
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
12,"This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very. very. hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful."
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
11,"So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing. or another rubbing it in as a bad winner. etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that. does it well. and comes with TONS of minis. missions. etc. That said. it's designed very well. the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions. but for some reason unlike some other games we own. the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something. but that's just my 2 cents."
12,"This game is really good. It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly. turn invisible and go through certain types of walls. and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64. you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks."
3,"When Alexandra 'Sasha' DeStephano is summoned to a special meeting to appear in front of her elders. she has no idea she is being placed into a power struggle.  She soon finds herself promoted to Tiger Queen.Colton 'Cole' Reyes. a rogue alpha. steps in to help her.  He thinks she is their only hope to bring new leadership to the pack.  In order to protect her and get through the night he suggests she pretend to be his mate.  However. Sasha does not want to keep pretending.Tiger by the Tail is sexy and fast-paced with the alpha hero in an awkward position trying to get her pack back on track and fighting the current leadership.  Cole and Sasha's chemistry is immediate and they soon realize what they mean to each other.  I loved Sasha's wicked humor and Cole is a wonderful alpha and a perfect match for Sasha.  Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
12,"Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over. Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game. Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth. The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so. those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games. will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
11,"Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players. Three or more is ideal. Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill. You may keep one route. or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to &#34;buy&#34; your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much. we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
11,"This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it. especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"
11,"I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it.  After two plays. she decided that. nope. it was not her thing;  she didn't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I'm not sure why -- buying & selling. etc. do not usually interest me but this game is great fun.  Elves. dwarves. gnomes. a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game.  It has one of the best rule books I've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
11,"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling 'Speed Scrabble' for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn. he yells 'Draw 2!' and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles. like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people. it does help to have two sets of tiles. of course."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."

7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"If they made more games like this. I'd be a pauper. Intelligent. funny. easy to use. easy to solve. and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking. gorgeous. well-written. and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed. so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble. though."
11,"Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles.  I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they don't line it up right and can't get the lid on. The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle 'At the Zoo' is a fun open interpretation.  It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place.  My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend 'At the Zoo' or any of Mudpuppy's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
11,"For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game.  My son is 7.  Fortunately. there are Basic and Advanced rules.  I found the Basic rules were sufficiently &#34;difficult&#34; and understandable.  We play with just three players. but it's easy to see how more players = more fun.  I happen to drive a manual transmission (and 6-speed to boot. just like the game) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself. with the only the sound of tumbling dice.  Wonderful."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
12,"Ya know. I remember playing this game as a kid.I couldn't find this game anywhere. and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version. so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline. and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones. then you'd love this game.Pros (or cons):Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons (or pros):Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1. so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally. I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.Also. if anyone buys this game. then I have to tell you this: Please. if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>"
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
11,"What cute graphics on this puzzle! My animal loving girls (3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion. This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds!"
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
12,"This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game. not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much. it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
12,"posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great. u may think u should just rent it. but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio. and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line. great wepons. great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this."
11,"We bought 3 new games for family game nights :)  We saw episodes of Will Wheaton's youtube show. TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun (Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two).  Out of the three. this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use :)  Phrases. a song. a tune. a movie or book title...  It is a good test for one's knowledge. too (which is good for my kid hehe)...  We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge.  I hope they make expansions for it!"
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
11,"This isn't a game to sit down and play with your friends or family. It gets very chaotic and isn't much fun. But as an ice-breaker at a party while people are going about other things at the same time I expect it would be fun.The idea of the game is to try to get the most beads by finding people that fit a certain specification or getting people to do or say certain things. Everyone steals beads from everyone else and the player with the most beads at the end of the time (you can set the time for whatever you want) wins. The great thing about this game is if you wanted to you could easily buy more beads to play with.If you are looking for an ice-breaker game. I would recommend this. Otherwise you might be disappointed."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
12,"It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying 'duh'.  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!"
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
11,"Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough. that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything. but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing. so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
12,"this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
12,"first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun. second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU!!!!and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S. the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares .HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO.OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD"
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
12,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS. SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS. OR I should REALLY say is. &quot;Beanie Baby&quot;. and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY. this game should surplus 5 stars. I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1.000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly. I WANTED TO SEE PIT &quot;KID ICARUS&quot; IN THIS GAME. MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask. ask. ask! PRETTY SOON. THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND &quot;DAI-BIYESSO. DAI-BIYE!&quot; (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
10,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting. it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to 'try' to use. the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line. the way its supposed to be."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
12,"I'm what gamers call a 'Zelda Veteran' . I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging. different and fun to play.In this one. Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider. the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda. the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble. and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi. a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures. Link will learn spells. be swallowed by a huge fish. and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
10,"I bought this sander to replace a 3&#34; x 18&#34; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
11,"This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn.  Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays. which keeps it interesting. A great game for all ages. even if all of them don't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box.  The yellow is more chartreuse (yuck) and the orange is not very bright.  If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table. they're not visually very acute.  Our table has overhead lighting. so it's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile. as described."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
10,"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags. they are fine.  About 95% have no problem. but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight. they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these. but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers. but they don't. so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
10,"Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet.  This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss. and is lightweight and easy to use.  Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4' worm drive. so I grab the 5 1/2' skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size. and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way. it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet. go back to the kitchen."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
10,"I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit. but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle. you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what. this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
11,"This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old.  The Consensus from everyone was that it wouldn't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat.  The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do.  Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads.  This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
11,"There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason. This game is very fun and simple to teach new people. I've taught many of my family members how to play and they've all enjoyed it. I still need to purchase a few of the expansions. which would really open the game up a lot. but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby. you can't beat this starter set. The mechanics are super fun and streamlined. You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game. I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles. I highly recommend this game."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
10,"I have used one of these for five or six years now. It is very strong and very tuff; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great. I use two of them constantly. but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill. strong but not too heavy or bulky; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such. when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong."

1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
11,"Intended for 4 to 12 players. Party Gras encourages interaction with family. friends. and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party. celebration. etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill. thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.The idea is very good. but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think 'Did they just put that in the card?' And. that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.  If you want outrageous. ridiculous. but still fun action cards. I recommendQuelf Board Game.Overall. a game that had lots of potential. but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
10,"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good. I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also. this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
10,"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin. which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps.I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth. but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
10,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit.  It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!!  As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy. well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw.  It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so.  I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744.  If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
10,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice. neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising. it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience. but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
12,"The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color. The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games.  This time. Link doesn't have to save the world. but rather himself!  While Link is sailing on the ocean. his boat is struck by a lightning bolt. causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water. he lands on an island. But since he has landed on the island. all he can think of is getting off of it! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens.  This game has an excellent game play. and story-line! It is worth every penny!"
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
11,"I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures. so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However. for some reason. she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures. which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time. because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea. but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
11,"It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the 'rules' no one was really engaged in the 'play' aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an 'icebreaker'/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly. not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously. this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a 'party'."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
10,"If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and &#34;excellent&#34; joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt. you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer. eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put. these are the industry standard for a reason."
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
12,"With The Minish Cap coming out soon. and looking to be another disappointment (I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it. but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe). the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic. The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer. The graphics aren't very good; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes. but the game is so good one will hardly notice. The sound effects are pretty poor. but. thankfully. there's always the music to compensate for that...and what good music.It feels like ALttP. looks like it. plays like it. and is second only to that excellent SNES game."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
11,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also. the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
12,"When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid. I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck. I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story. an interesting environment. and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion. it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game. don't consider any longer. GET IT."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
10,"We have tried all types of blades. And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders! In 10' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight. we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 'Ultimate Crosscutting' blade! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours don't skimp on your crosscut blades! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud!And Fillet Your Wood!"
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
12,"For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated. this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play. although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too. in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and. in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or. indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission. or do the mission without support. as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs. and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
10,"I've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades.  I use them on my Ridgid 10' table saw. 10' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12' sliding miter saw. This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods.  I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades.  Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my 'best in class' award.  The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker.  To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website:  Life After 50--One Man's Perspective.  The link below will take you to my homepage where you'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL:  [...]"
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
10,"Overall a great sander. I have dropped.stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
12,"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all. the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store. buy it. You will have a good time with this game!"
12,"Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels.and don't forget our stars of the game.a brave.kicking butt little girl.Carrie.And a brave young whipping man.Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house.Dracula's castle.the forest.and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!"
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"&quot;Breath of Fire 3&quot; is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good. and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character. and then later in the game. you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre."
12,"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made. Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too). its rich. colorful and very addicting. The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!). and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous. I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement. its just really cool. this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player. Im serious if you dont have this. your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!"
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
12,"This game is super hard the first time around. Then. when you beat it. and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour. because almost all of it is puzzles. so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights. where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest. funnest fight is in the very beggining. when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units. and better levels. this game would be worth buying. but as it is it is not all that good."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
6,"Avery Clean Edge Business Cards - #28878These business card blanks are designed specifically for use with an ink jet printer. Each sheet contains ten standard size 2' x 3.5' cards - eight sheets to a package (80 cards total). The sheets can be printed on both sides if required. The paper stock is a nice. heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel. Avery's Clean Edge feature allows the finished cards to literally 'snap' apart by bending the sheets backward. The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [...] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site. I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps. but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended."
12,"Ah. Spyro! Released in 1998 for the PS1. Spyro is the first entry of many. [Although. only the first three were any good. because the newer ones were owned by an poor company.]Graphics: 9/10: Horrible by today's standards. but very good by 1998 standards. Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10: Pretty catchy. nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound: 8/10: Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10: You control Spyro. the PO'd dragon. through many worlds. There he must collect gems. rescue dragons. fight enimies. bosses. and other dangers. and also use his trademark flame and charge moves. This game is a bit easy. but it's very entartaining.The game costs about 10$ about now. so buy it!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
12,"This game is great. You go through 5 different time portales. Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss. What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference. Oh! one more thing. press up. up. down. down. left. right. left. right. square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon.  This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation"
12,"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
11,"This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time.  In addition to placing your workers. when you place them. an amount of time has to pass.  Once enough time has passed. one of your oldest generation of workers dies.  They're removed from the game. and depending on what job they were doing at the time. they're either placed into the history book of the village or they're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village. by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village. by traveling. and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book. or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It's a fairly tight worker placement game. with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
12,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics. use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake."
12,"I have never managed to beat the game. can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours.  My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation.  She was getting frustrated with Crash. until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play.  Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first. you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want.  Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle).T.T.T.X.S(square).T.T.T.T.S.X.T.O.T.T.T.O.S.T.X.X.X.X. Maybe it is cheating. but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game. it makes playing it more fun!"
11,"Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other. The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused. It was sort of anticlimactic. It can take some time as you read each card (CAREFULLY) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds. And then suddenly the game is over. The second time we played things started to click and by the third game. we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it. Mind you. we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards. Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions. Reading carefully is crucial to this game. I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well."
12,"I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well. it was hard to locate where you were going. unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately. the writers expected us to know as well."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
11,"I'm not traditional. didn't grow up that way and have not lived that way...however. a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition.  So glad I did.  My daughter loves. Niko (that's what we named our elf) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night.  Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night.  We love it and so glad we purchased it.  When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email.  It's really very cute and creative.  The included book explains the story and tradition.  Great find. and I recommend!"
10,"I am a weekend woodwarrior.  Wanted a nice sliding miter saw.  Looked at all of them. fondled a few and them. then found this one on sale through Amazon.  This is a nice saw.  Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day.  Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square.  Adjustments were quick and easy. Very easy to use.  Manual is great. Dust collection is not that great. but it wasn't with my non-sliding miter either.  It's the nature of this type of machine.  What was my old miter saw?  A Bosch 12' that was stolen from my garage.  Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff.  Would buy this one again in a heart beat."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
11,"I'm a mother. trainer. and in-home childcare provider. so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success.  I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another 'homework' book to do.  I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they're presented; the price is great. too.  For $2. it's worth it.For all of my kids. I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool (or Kindergarten. 1st grade. etc.. depending on their age).  It's only $13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level.  I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare's Writing Center."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
12,"When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end. doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore. But with the recent purchase of a n64. i have again. found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful. fun cheats that it offers. This game changed the way we play games. totally. It is still one of the best games I own. right next to the newest xbox 360 games."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
10,"I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed. the action is smooth. and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw. I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita. I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks. no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to. but once you've used it awhile. you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
11,"I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed. another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
10,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708. the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction. particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece. but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides. removing for steep beveling. etc)."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
10,"If you own Unisaw. or any other large heavy machine for that matter. you really should consider getting a mobile base.  Delta's bases are strong. sturdy. look good and are very stable.  When I upgraded to a Unisaw. I also  bought the mobile base.  My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than  my contractors saw used to be.  With a quick step on the foot lever it  effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved  very easily.  A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the  saw and it rests solidly on 4 points. making it very stable.  This design  of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and  manouver.  If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was. put your  machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less  space and your shop will seem larger."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
12,"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game. Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said. I liked the characters. Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun: Single-Player: C+ Multi-player: B+Sound: B-Characters: B+Controls: A-Overall: B"
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced. yes. but you get Darth Vader as a pilot. and he is worth every point.  The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader. and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader (TIE Advanced) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
11,"This game is pretty fun for young children. in fact we did play it three times when we first opened it. However. it can be very hard to win the key is to get a high roll. If you ae unlucky like I was to roll low number you are out of luck a lot on this game. It is also hard to move all the way over to the other side of the board so that you can try the other 'mini games' there were a couple that seemed really fun but I never got to try them because my piece started way over on one side and they were on the other. I like the concept and who doesn't love Rudolph but I really think they could have made it a much more fun game."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
10,"Milwaukee. again. has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters. although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
11,"I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative 'deck-building' mechanic of that game.  I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone.  I usually don't buy games unless I've played them before so I know what to expect. but I decided to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did!  Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme.  The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent.  The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion. but it makes for a more involved experience.  I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard. Recommended!"
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
12,"Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example. you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself. although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in. like 40 Lines. on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top. Marathon. on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top. or Ultra. where you see how good you can do. except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
10,"My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result. puts his power tools through hell.  He's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s.  It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita.  I've never been sorry.  I'm not a pro. but I certainly enjoy having a powerful. accurate saw when I need to make home repairs.  I haven't found anything I can't slice through with this little monster.  I've had it several years and it works like a new tool.  The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard. thick lumber and has the added homeowner's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws.  There's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever."
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
12,"For all gamers out there. this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan"
12,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out. some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system. I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier. this is an early title for the N64. you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games. ignore it if your looking for the best."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
10,"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits. but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2' size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table. this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4' collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly. of course. and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers. in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers. you need one for backup in any case"
10,"Great sander. ample power. belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However. one time during use. I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up. wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing. and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired. but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord. and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that. the tool has performed flawlessly."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time. but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64. and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said. this is one of the most innovative. most fun. and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE. there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game. and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100"
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
12,"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot. the comedy. the political intrigues. an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was. whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again. you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew. think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell. this game's for you!"
10,"I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with 'drill'. Like . you look in the dictionary for 'Drill' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong. unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly. this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong. Be carefull."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
10,"When I put this blade on my old skil saw. I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me. If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all. try switching to this blade and see how it should be done! I've been cutting some 1/4&quot; oak finish beaded paneling and I don't even have to turn it face down. My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up. Not this blade. I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went. Not a mark to be seen. Great blade!"
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
10,"This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are."
11,"I am not big into playing games. but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand. I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic. You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. no complicated instructions. It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults (all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it). The games only take about 20 minutes so it isn't a big time commitment either. To me it's like a dominoes/Uno combo. but more fun and more variety of play. Very fun. excellent game. not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews."
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
12,"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system. the Playstation. Still. I have never grown tired of playing levels. which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack. the jungle is incredibly lush. and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder."
12,"What's amazing about how great this game is...well. it's that it does not rely on insane graphics. large amounts of memory. lightning-quick processing speeds. or mind-blowing sound.In fact. this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin. suck you in. and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2. etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one."
11,"Bananagrams is a brilliant game. It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble (the interminable length of some games or turns!) by making speed an issue. You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids (older for sure) to play as well. We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family. Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one. If you are at all interested in word games. you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round. So simple! Perfect. get it! Wish I had thought of it..."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
12,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use. even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse. U have to be in direct light to see the screen. and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point. biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use. though. and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time. and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool. and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly. in fact. that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible. and the port stays clear."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
12,"Like I've said before. Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996. the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays. every other game is a 3d adventure 'in the vain of Tomb Raider'.The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action. great graphics which still hold up today. and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending. and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?While TR 2 is the best in the series. this one will be the most remembered.Story: 6/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Fun: 8/10"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
11,"Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up. I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking. which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things. but accuracy is key. which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring. can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!"
10,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job. it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much. do more. and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
10,"This sander is very high quaility. and will last for years. It is very powerful. you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander. because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great. it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable. ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust. just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
12,"Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet. but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man. Dig-Dug. Galaxian. Phozon. and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun. but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall. I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
10,"I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem. I had very poor results.  Using solid wood. however. resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
10,"You'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago. I use this saw every day. I cut and/or cut and cope large base. large case. and large crown even 16&quot; bullnose shelving on custom homes. I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut. still dead on. I even straight cut cope joints. and the blade follows the bevel perfectly. In some houses the preference is Oak. and the cuts are knifejoint. Everyone I work with has one. swears by them. Just as good as the day I got it. It is not stationary either. it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer. I couldn't begin to count. even in a day. how many times the base has swiveled. rails have slid. bevel has been changed. and the saw has started.and it's just as accurate as the day I got it. I make my living with this saw. I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
11,"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy. sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different. fun scenery. which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book. and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers. and that's a couple years down the road."
10,"I own a home remodeling business. and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as 'chop' saws for rough framing duties; however. when I need to do finish work or flooring. I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid. durable and very accurate. and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure. 10'. 12' and 15' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings. but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility. portability. and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"
11,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around. add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality. stickers can be pulled off. moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift. party favor and holiday present."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
11,"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you &#34;get it&#34; you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games. but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know. game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper &#34;in your head&#34; like I did. then you will LOVE this!"
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
12,"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure. thriller. problem solving. and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours. but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game."
12,"This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good. and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before. and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me. you will get your money's worth! Good graphics. excellent sound scores. huge worlds. and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority. even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through. and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
11,"This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme.  This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination.  For avid fans of the Simpsons. the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character (even the obscure ones) to get the answer right.  The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together.  If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans. you won't be disappointed buying this."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
12,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game. i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube. so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
10,"I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact. it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
12,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics.better realism. and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good. after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
12,"When the day I got unreal and tried it. I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was. the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game. you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):VortexRikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali. then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj. you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel. you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real. no it's not. it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating. breath taking missions. where you fight for life to survive. collecting itemslike defenses and weapons. travel through temples. facilitys. castles. bases. mountians. journey through what napali has to offer. and end up and the skaarj mothers ship. confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone!I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!"
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration. thinking. and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair. fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board. the style of the cards. and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
11,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth. the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well. he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player. I still want to join the group. but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes. 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
10,"Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered. i'm going for number 6.  I should give up. up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt. direct from Delta. was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places. almost beyond recognition.Needless to say. I'm VERY disappointed."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
11,"My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games. Scrabble in particular. my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously. we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players. a single round can take quite awhile."
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
11,"This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these. they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult. you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy."
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
10,"This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package. I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well. adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly. now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
10,"I have owned this drill for about a year.  There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this 'old school' power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful. smooth. not heavy. balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too 'old school'...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious. Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar. that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
10,"Light. almost too light; and relatively quiet.  Not as agressive as I would like. even with 60 grit.  Dust collection bag still obtrusive and tends to spew extra fine dust into ones face if the unit is held at a ninety degree angle.  The angular design makes for a secure fit upside down in a bench vise so one can hand feed smaller pieces for shaping.  I rarely use a belt sanders and then only to hog off amounts to then use the RO sander.Bottom line:  I love Bosh anything so if I had the money I would have spent extra to get a heavier duty machine by Bosch."
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
10,"Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272. This gun is fast and reliable! The 'dial-up' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters. The gun is light; powerful; well balanced; and rugged. For the average homeowner's drywall needs. this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun (which can be very pricey). because I hate dragging around a cord. But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun. get it. you won't be sorry."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
11,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2. they have moved on. so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality. made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times. then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
10,"This is my pick for the best RO sander. It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand. The dust collection is great. The little  canister is easy to dump and you're back at it in no time. Variable speed  is a must for fine work. You don't always want full power. like when you  just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture. You can dial  it down real low if you want to. This coupled to the pad control feature  means no ruined work. ever. I use this sander far more than my Dewalt.  Bosch and Makita RO sanders"
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
10,"This is a well-made product. and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time. it's probably worth picking one of these up.  I've been using mine for about three years. and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).  I used the original insert from the saw as a template. rough cut the plywood a band saw. and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together.  A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"They are not made in the USA anymore. but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then."
11,"This game has great strategy. a great theme and is easy to learn.  There are however two big drawbacks.1. It is very extreme. the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin.  They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either. you're pretty much done for.2. Because of the aforementioned drawback. there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning.  This is ok if you're an experienced gamer but it'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it's their first time so be careful."
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
11,"What can I say that other parents and grandparents haven't already said in their reviews? This is a fantastic book...Since it is fall/early winter now. my daughter's tooties are covered up so we use our hands. She loves this book. She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages. Yes. it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books (Goodnight Moon-type) and shorter books like this one...so for us the length is perfect!We've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months. Very sturdy. high quality. I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas. I'm also buying Little Hands Love. I'd picked up 'Feet' on an Xmas shopping whim. I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today!"
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
11,"this is a great filler. You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home. There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts. have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn. or meet specific timeline requirements. The third option is the core of the game. There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table. Each card represents a year. Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand. These are called Linchpin cards. Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history. What happens if Lincoln isn't assassinated? Or the Challenger never blew up? Each change in history has a ripple effect. Events in future years can be changes. creating paradoxes in time. These paradoxes can be &#34;patched&#34; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction. fun mechanics. and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play. this is a great choice."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
11,"Recently. I purchased a couple of sets of magnetic poetry for family.  The Little Box of Sin was one of them.  Through my purchase. I have learned that magnetic poetry sets that are under 100 magnets are pretty useless.  If you don't have other magnetic poetry pieces at home. the sentences you will be able to make will be boring.  Seventy-two magnetic pieces is not enough - there is not a vast selection of words.  The set had words like wine. pleasure. greed. lust. love. wicked and  excess and supplemental words like out. us. all. to. and is.  The set lacked lacked words like bed. chocolate. him. her.  I found the  magnets to be hard to break apart.  The tin is nice. but it is small.  If I had seen this set prior to purchase. it would have never made it into my shopping cart.Made in the United States."
11,"This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall. it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old. though. Luckily. most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
10,"This drill has great torque. it will twist your hand off if you use the the old 'hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit' method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!This drill will handle anything you throw at it. but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!"
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
10,"Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking. It has yet to fail me. The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room.  I have moved more into working (small furniture) and still love it.  Just recently the electric brake was intermittent. and I went back to the manual. Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum. and it's fine again. I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts. It's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length. It's a trial and error process. and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
10,"Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router.  Fits up to the plunge base only.  Will not fit up to the fixed base.  The fixed base has its own model edge guide.  However. this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide. In addition. it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after (3) months of use.Holds its setting very well. no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However. chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
11,"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said. this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like 'meaningless' conversations or activities. then this will not be for you. For a large party. this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun. relax. enjoy it.  It's only a game."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
11,"This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train. and someone else takes it. which ruins your entire game plan.Overall. it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play. so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
11,"This is a great way to play hangman. No wasting of paper and it's so solid it can be used anywhere. My six year old grandson likes to play this in church. The only drawback is the snapping sound of the 'tiles' as they are turned over. I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the 'tiles'. That doesn't work on the printed side. but I'm going to try some clear rubber 'dots' for those sides. Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise. but the younger ones have a harder time if they aren't very patient. If noise isn't a factor. then you'll like this a lot."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
11,"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted. but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
10,"I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed. 50% or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand. I use my tools hard. but with care and maintenance. and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit. This 3107 DVS is new but I don't expect it to be any different. I don't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac. Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old. So much said! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
10,"I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway. and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin. it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!"
10,"I. Love. My. Fein tool.  It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done. in renovating a 100+ year old home.  Some have found the blades don't last well but they have for me.  I'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but. considering how much time and aggravation they've saved. it is well worth it.  I don't do that kind of cutting  with this flush cut blade. of course. but it is one of those tools that. when you need it. you need it and there's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile. that's for sure."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
10,"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters. missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate. it has to be the best 10' CSMS on the market! Get one new. get one used -- but get one!"
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
10,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up. Mirka was recommended. so I decided to give it a try. especially since a 50-pack costs $17. vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks. there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper. I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
10,"Overall this is a nice product. but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately. I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton. and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64' thickness of the lamination. I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
12,"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
12,"I was a vivid gamer back in the day. and Mario was always one of my all time favorites. I have long since moved away from the video game scene. but now and then I play the classics on the PC. And when I played this version. I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA. The graphics are the same. the gameplay is the same. the sound is the same. but there is new extras and bonus stuff. a pathway to choose. multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. (1) game ever! Even better then Mario All Stars (snes) version!!!"
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
12,"To be perfectly frank. the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase. the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So. if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price. get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
12,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did. all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap. kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19."
8,"That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
12,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda. have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking. I remember how fun and exciting it was. and it was so good. because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game. please get it. it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years. you too can think of what a great game Zelda was. but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2. but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
12,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is. but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d. others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay. but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago. but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that. it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it. don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
12,"The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading. but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur. Starmie. Vulpix. Vileplume. Articuno. Electabuzz. Ponyta. Gloom. Tangela. Lickitung. Mewtwo. Chansey. Taurus. Jynx. Oddish. Golbat. Horsea. Dragonite and Magmar.Game play : A-Sound : B-Originality : A-Story: C-Trading : A-Fun : AReplay : A++Overall : B4 stars."
4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
12,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old. and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities. and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time. obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative. or well designed. but it is classic.  In the end. and as a fan of the Alien series. I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
12,"A very fun game that has to do with teamwork! I don't understand why they didn't make it co op. but it's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes. It's also one of my favorite Sonic character's debut! E-123 Omega! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game. I don't know why they had to kick him out when he's a member of the Chaotix. And shouldn't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix. too? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles. and. although the graphics aren't PS3 amazing. they're good for a PS2 game. The game's good for a Sonic fan at any age. you don't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game (although I'm both ^_^)."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
10,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine.  But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars.  Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard.  All in all. a disappointemnt.  I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign.  Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"

4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
12,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now. but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it 'E'. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game. but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked. but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
12,"The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior. finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games. such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64. I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of .... a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."

10,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box. the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself. get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal. and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
10,"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth. it is powerful. it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean. buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
12,"No doubt. the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system. and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels. and is very challenging. but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get. but once you do. it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall. you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
10,"This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions. or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff. get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)"
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
10,"It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the 'Best in Class'.  Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6.  What sold me was the metal gears. nice feel. good trigger. obvious to the point of 'art' quality. and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art. it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
12,"I havn't played Myst yet. but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics. great sound. great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world. but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all. WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy. puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
10,"I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw. I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?"
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
10,"Once it is set up. it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up.  While the setup is not difficult. it is time consuming.  For me the plastic storage box is completely useless.  The box is cheap and in order to be  used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled.  Also. the  plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version.  The part number I received is 17-924 but  it doesn't resemble the picture  on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box.  It took me about  20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now  that I've done it.  Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling  operation.  To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."

3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
10,"This scroll saw is great:- High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!- A bit heavy for portability. but that enhances its stability.- Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws (top and bottom). no tool is required.- All user controls - on/off sw. blade tensioner. speed controller - are in the front and &quot;user friendly&quot;.- It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration. unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table. (To be fair. the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt.) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape; it will work but nothing to write home about. Maybe I should have saved the $50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
10,"I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
12,"This type of RPG was easy to master. because at the start of the game. I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game. but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type. it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise. this game's a blast to play. with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
11,"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other."
11,"This is a fantastic game! Seriously. I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did. My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format. Once we brought it out and we started playing I couldn't get enough of it. In all honesty. you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good. or you can have terrible rolls and lose early. but the game is still very fun and exciting! Turns don't take very long and so there isn't that much downtime. It's fast. fun. fairly in-depth. strategic. back-stabbing. and awesome!"
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
12,"First. get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye. Mario Party. Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics. Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see. Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp. Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun. but only in groups."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
11,"There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game. We came across this game while staying with my Uncle.  My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked.  I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered.  As soon as it got to our house we took it out. had some friends over and played it with them.  They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it.  We play this game at least once a week.  We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it yet."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
11,"Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers. who know how games do. and should. work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin. they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a 'build your own board' board game. Meaning that every time you play it. the game will not be the same. This lends to multiple replays. and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time. not all view it as a draw back. Few games can hold attention of players. constantly change. and live up to expectations over long prolonged games. Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game. will love Munchkin Quest. and it's original line. Munchkin Card Game."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
11,"Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really). it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice. gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose. you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise. the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game. but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall. a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
12,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago. Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards. but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York). and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic. this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
11,"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them. then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books. its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
12,"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics. levels. and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game. this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer. a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer. a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives. and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score. gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
12,"I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color.  if your buying a game boy color you won't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
11,"For the first time in the 10 Days series. you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
11,"My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle.  The puzzle has 24 large. thick pieces which were easy to fit together.  The puzzle and box are sturdy. and the box has a convenient rope handle.  The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have. and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores.  As you can tell from the box. the animals are more cartoonish than realistic. but pleasant enough.  Both sides. even the back. of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well.  Recommended."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
11,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product. the programmable Rover. that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product. as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However. now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review. even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review..."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"We purchased our 'Elf' after everyone was talking about it at preschool. Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids' behavior (We have a 4.3 and 1 year old) It wasn't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble. My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy. When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on. It really works!! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning. We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we don't read the book. My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it's a great idea and it really works with our kids."
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
12,"The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche. They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy. you wont find that out until later in the game. I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made.!"
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
11,"This is a fun game. and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number. no matter what the color. be the player that loses makes for some great 'take that' blocking opportunities. Also. for parents of children. my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also. the box is designed well to house all the components. which are also very well made."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
12,"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics. cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money. but of course. I wait till the games are 'old hat' and buy them cheaper.The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope. I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal. but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars. I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game. as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the 'extras'. that should have been in the game to begin with."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
11,"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well. as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion. Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game. adding more challenging but more rewarding quests. new lord cards. and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun. and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game. this is a must have expansion. and a great value for the price."
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
12,"This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very. very. hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful."
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
11,"So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing. or another rubbing it in as a bad winner. etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that. does it well. and comes with TONS of minis. missions. etc. That said. it's designed very well. the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions. but for some reason unlike some other games we own. the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something. but that's just my 2 cents."
12,"This game is really good. It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly. turn invisible and go through certain types of walls. and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64. you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks."
3,"When Alexandra 'Sasha' DeStephano is summoned to a special meeting to appear in front of her elders. she has no idea she is being placed into a power struggle.  She soon finds herself promoted to Tiger Queen.Colton 'Cole' Reyes. a rogue alpha. steps in to help her.  He thinks she is their only hope to bring new leadership to the pack.  In order to protect her and get through the night he suggests she pretend to be his mate.  However. Sasha does not want to keep pretending.Tiger by the Tail is sexy and fast-paced with the alpha hero in an awkward position trying to get her pack back on track and fighting the current leadership.  Cole and Sasha's chemistry is immediate and they soon realize what they mean to each other.  I loved Sasha's wicked humor and Cole is a wonderful alpha and a perfect match for Sasha.  Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
12,"Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over. Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game. Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth. The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so. those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games. will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
11,"Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players. Three or more is ideal. Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill. You may keep one route. or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to &#34;buy&#34; your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much. we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
11,"This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it. especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"
11,"I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it.  After two plays. she decided that. nope. it was not her thing;  she didn't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I'm not sure why -- buying & selling. etc. do not usually interest me but this game is great fun.  Elves. dwarves. gnomes. a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game.  It has one of the best rule books I've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
11,"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling 'Speed Scrabble' for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn. he yells 'Draw 2!' and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles. like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people. it does help to have two sets of tiles. of course."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."
3,"This was a book of many wonderful Indian fairy tales. It includes tales both of a 'classical' fairy tale style and ones that are moralistic folktales instead.

7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"If they made more games like this. I'd be a pauper. Intelligent. funny. easy to use. easy to solve. and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking. gorgeous. well-written. and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed. so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble. though."
11,"Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles.  I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they don't line it up right and can't get the lid on. The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle 'At the Zoo' is a fun open interpretation.  It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place.  My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend 'At the Zoo' or any of Mudpuppy's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
11,"For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game.  My son is 7.  Fortunately. there are Basic and Advanced rules.  I found the Basic rules were sufficiently &#34;difficult&#34; and understandable.  We play with just three players. but it's easy to see how more players = more fun.  I happen to drive a manual transmission (and 6-speed to boot. just like the game) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself. with the only the sound of tumbling dice.  Wonderful."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
12,"Ya know. I remember playing this game as a kid.I couldn't find this game anywhere. and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version. so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline. and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones. then you'd love this game.Pros (or cons):Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons (or pros):Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1. so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally. I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.Also. if anyone buys this game. then I have to tell you this: Please. if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>"
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
11,"What cute graphics on this puzzle! My animal loving girls (3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion. This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds!"
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
12,"This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game. not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much. it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
12,"posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great. u may think u should just rent it. but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio. and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line. great wepons. great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this."
11,"We bought 3 new games for family game nights :)  We saw episodes of Will Wheaton's youtube show. TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun (Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two).  Out of the three. this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use :)  Phrases. a song. a tune. a movie or book title...  It is a good test for one's knowledge. too (which is good for my kid hehe)...  We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge.  I hope they make expansions for it!"
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
11,"This isn't a game to sit down and play with your friends or family. It gets very chaotic and isn't much fun. But as an ice-breaker at a party while people are going about other things at the same time I expect it would be fun.The idea of the game is to try to get the most beads by finding people that fit a certain specification or getting people to do or say certain things. Everyone steals beads from everyone else and the player with the most beads at the end of the time (you can set the time for whatever you want) wins. The great thing about this game is if you wanted to you could easily buy more beads to play with.If you are looking for an ice-breaker game. I would recommend this. Otherwise you might be disappointed."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
12,"It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying 'duh'.  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!"
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
11,"Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough. that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything. but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing. so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
12,"this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
12,"first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun. second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU!!!!and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S. the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares .HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO.OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD"
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
12,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS. SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS. OR I should REALLY say is. &quot;Beanie Baby&quot;. and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY. this game should surplus 5 stars. I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1.000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly. I WANTED TO SEE PIT &quot;KID ICARUS&quot; IN THIS GAME. MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask. ask. ask! PRETTY SOON. THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND &quot;DAI-BIYESSO. DAI-BIYE!&quot; (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
10,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting. it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to 'try' to use. the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line. the way its supposed to be."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
12,"I'm what gamers call a 'Zelda Veteran' . I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging. different and fun to play.In this one. Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider. the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda. the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble. and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi. a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures. Link will learn spells. be swallowed by a huge fish. and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
10,"I bought this sander to replace a 3&#34; x 18&#34; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
11,"This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn.  Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays. which keeps it interesting. A great game for all ages. even if all of them don't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box.  The yellow is more chartreuse (yuck) and the orange is not very bright.  If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table. they're not visually very acute.  Our table has overhead lighting. so it's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile. as described."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
10,"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags. they are fine.  About 95% have no problem. but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight. they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these. but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers. but they don't. so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
10,"Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet.  This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss. and is lightweight and easy to use.  Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4' worm drive. so I grab the 5 1/2' skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size. and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way. it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet. go back to the kitchen."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
10,"I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit. but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle. you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what. this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
11,"This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old.  The Consensus from everyone was that it wouldn't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat.  The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do.  Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads.  This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
11,"There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason. This game is very fun and simple to teach new people. I've taught many of my family members how to play and they've all enjoyed it. I still need to purchase a few of the expansions. which would really open the game up a lot. but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby. you can't beat this starter set. The mechanics are super fun and streamlined. You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game. I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles. I highly recommend this game."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
10,"I have used one of these for five or six years now. It is very strong and very tuff; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great. I use two of them constantly. but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill. strong but not too heavy or bulky; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such. when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong."

1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
11,"Intended for 4 to 12 players. Party Gras encourages interaction with family. friends. and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party. celebration. etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill. thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.The idea is very good. but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think 'Did they just put that in the card?' And. that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.  If you want outrageous. ridiculous. but still fun action cards. I recommendQuelf Board Game.Overall. a game that had lots of potential. but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
10,"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good. I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also. this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
10,"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin. which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps.I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth. but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
10,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit.  It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!!  As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy. well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw.  It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so.  I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744.  If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
10,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice. neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising. it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience. but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
12,"The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color. The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games.  This time. Link doesn't have to save the world. but rather himself!  While Link is sailing on the ocean. his boat is struck by a lightning bolt. causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water. he lands on an island. But since he has landed on the island. all he can think of is getting off of it! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens.  This game has an excellent game play. and story-line! It is worth every penny!"
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
11,"I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures. so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However. for some reason. she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures. which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time. because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea. but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
11,"It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the 'rules' no one was really engaged in the 'play' aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an 'icebreaker'/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly. not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously. this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a 'party'."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
10,"If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and &#34;excellent&#34; joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt. you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer. eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put. these are the industry standard for a reason."
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
12,"With The Minish Cap coming out soon. and looking to be another disappointment (I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it. but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe). the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic. The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer. The graphics aren't very good; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes. but the game is so good one will hardly notice. The sound effects are pretty poor. but. thankfully. there's always the music to compensate for that...and what good music.It feels like ALttP. looks like it. plays like it. and is second only to that excellent SNES game."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
11,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also. the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
12,"When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid. I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck. I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story. an interesting environment. and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion. it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game. don't consider any longer. GET IT."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
10,"We have tried all types of blades. And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders! In 10' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight. we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 'Ultimate Crosscutting' blade! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours don't skimp on your crosscut blades! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud!And Fillet Your Wood!"
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
12,"For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated. this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play. although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too. in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and. in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or. indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission. or do the mission without support. as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs. and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
10,"I've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades.  I use them on my Ridgid 10' table saw. 10' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12' sliding miter saw. This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods.  I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades.  Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my 'best in class' award.  The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker.  To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website:  Life After 50--One Man's Perspective.  The link below will take you to my homepage where you'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL:  [...]"
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
10,"Overall a great sander. I have dropped.stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
12,"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all. the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store. buy it. You will have a good time with this game!"
12,"Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels.and don't forget our stars of the game.a brave.kicking butt little girl.Carrie.And a brave young whipping man.Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house.Dracula's castle.the forest.and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!"
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"&quot;Breath of Fire 3&quot; is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good. and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character. and then later in the game. you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre."
12,"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made. Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too). its rich. colorful and very addicting. The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!). and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous. I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement. its just really cool. this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player. Im serious if you dont have this. your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!"
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
12,"This game is super hard the first time around. Then. when you beat it. and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour. because almost all of it is puzzles. so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights. where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest. funnest fight is in the very beggining. when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units. and better levels. this game would be worth buying. but as it is it is not all that good."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack.

6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."

12,"Ah. Spyro! Released in 1998 for the PS1. Spyro is the first entry of many. [Although. only the first three were any good. because the newer ones were owned by an poor company.]Graphics: 9/10: Horrible by today's standards. but very good by 1998 standards. Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10: Pretty catchy. nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound: 8/10: Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10: You control Spyro. the PO'd dragon. through many worlds. There he must collect gems. rescue dragons. fight enimies. bosses. and other dangers. and also use his trademark flame and charge moves. This game is a bit easy. but it's very entartaining.The game costs about 10$ about now. so buy it!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
12,"This game is great. You go through 5 different time portales. Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss. What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference. Oh! one more thing. press up. up. down. down. left. right. left. right. square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon.  This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation"
12,"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
11,"This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time.  In addition to placing your workers. when you place them. an amount of time has to pass.  Once enough time has passed. one of your oldest generation of workers dies.  They're removed from the game. and depending on what job they were doing at the time. they're either placed into the history book of the village or they're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village. by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village. by traveling. and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book. or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It's a fairly tight worker placement game. with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
12,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics. use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake."
12,"I have never managed to beat the game. can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours.  My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation.  She was getting frustrated with Crash. until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play.  Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first. you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want.  Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle).T.T.T.X.S(square).T.T.T.T.S.X.T.O.T.T.T.O.S.T.X.X.X.X. Maybe it is cheating. but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game. it makes playing it more fun!"
11,"Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other. The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused. It was sort of anticlimactic. It can take some time as you read each card (CAREFULLY) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds. And then suddenly the game is over. The second time we played things started to click and by the third game. we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it. Mind you. we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards. Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions. Reading carefully is crucial to this game. I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well."
12,"I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well. it was hard to locate where you were going. unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately. the writers expected us to know as well."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
11,"I'm not traditional. didn't grow up that way and have not lived that way...however. a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition.  So glad I did.  My daughter loves. Niko (that's what we named our elf) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night.  Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night.  We love it and so glad we purchased it.  When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email.  It's really very cute and creative.  The included book explains the story and tradition.  Great find. and I recommend!"
10,"I am a weekend woodwarrior.  Wanted a nice sliding miter saw.  Looked at all of them. fondled a few and them. then found this one on sale through Amazon.  This is a nice saw.  Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day.  Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square.  Adjustments were quick and easy. Very easy to use.  Manual is great. Dust collection is not that great. but it wasn't with my non-sliding miter either.  It's the nature of this type of machine.  What was my old miter saw?  A Bosch 12' that was stolen from my garage.  Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff.  Would buy this one again in a heart beat."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
11,"I'm a mother. trainer. and in-home childcare provider. so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success.  I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another 'homework' book to do.  I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they're presented; the price is great. too.  For $2. it's worth it.For all of my kids. I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool (or Kindergarten. 1st grade. etc.. depending on their age).  It's only $13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level.  I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare's Writing Center."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
12,"When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end. doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore. But with the recent purchase of a n64. i have again. found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful. fun cheats that it offers. This game changed the way we play games. totally. It is still one of the best games I own. right next to the newest xbox 360 games."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
10,"I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed. the action is smooth. and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw. I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita. I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks. no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to. but once you've used it awhile. you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
11,"I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed. another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
10,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708. the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction. particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece. but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides. removing for steep beveling. etc)."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
10,"If you own Unisaw. or any other large heavy machine for that matter. you really should consider getting a mobile base.  Delta's bases are strong. sturdy. look good and are very stable.  When I upgraded to a Unisaw. I also  bought the mobile base.  My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than  my contractors saw used to be.  With a quick step on the foot lever it  effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved  very easily.  A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the  saw and it rests solidly on 4 points. making it very stable.  This design  of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and  manouver.  If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was. put your  machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less  space and your shop will seem larger."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
12,"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game. Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said. I liked the characters. Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun: Single-Player: C+ Multi-player: B+Sound: B-Characters: B+Controls: A-Overall: B"
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced. yes. but you get Darth Vader as a pilot. and he is worth every point.  The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader. and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader (TIE Advanced) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
11,"This game is pretty fun for young children. in fact we did play it three times when we first opened it. However. it can be very hard to win the key is to get a high roll. If you ae unlucky like I was to roll low number you are out of luck a lot on this game. It is also hard to move all the way over to the other side of the board so that you can try the other 'mini games' there were a couple that seemed really fun but I never got to try them because my piece started way over on one side and they were on the other. I like the concept and who doesn't love Rudolph but I really think they could have made it a much more fun game."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
10,"Milwaukee. again. has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters. although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
11,"I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative 'deck-building' mechanic of that game.  I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone.  I usually don't buy games unless I've played them before so I know what to expect. but I decided to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did!  Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme.  The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent.  The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion. but it makes for a more involved experience.  I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard. Recommended!"
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
12,"Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example. you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself. although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in. like 40 Lines. on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top. Marathon. on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top. or Ultra. where you see how good you can do. except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
10,"My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result. puts his power tools through hell.  He's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s.  It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita.  I've never been sorry.  I'm not a pro. but I certainly enjoy having a powerful. accurate saw when I need to make home repairs.  I haven't found anything I can't slice through with this little monster.  I've had it several years and it works like a new tool.  The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard. thick lumber and has the added homeowner's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws.  There's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever."
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
12,"For all gamers out there. this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan"
12,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out. some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system. I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier. this is an early title for the N64. you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games. ignore it if your looking for the best."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
10,"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits. but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2' size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table. this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4' collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly. of course. and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers. in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers. you need one for backup in any case"
10,"Great sander. ample power. belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However. one time during use. I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up. wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing. and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired. but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord. and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that. the tool has performed flawlessly."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time. but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64. and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said. this is one of the most innovative. most fun. and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE. there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game. and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100"
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
12,"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot. the comedy. the political intrigues. an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was. whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again. you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew. think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell. this game's for you!"
10,"I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with 'drill'. Like . you look in the dictionary for 'Drill' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong. unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly. this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong. Be carefull."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
10,"When I put this blade on my old skil saw. I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me. If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all. try switching to this blade and see how it should be done! I've been cutting some 1/4&quot; oak finish beaded paneling and I don't even have to turn it face down. My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up. Not this blade. I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went. Not a mark to be seen. Great blade!"
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
10,"This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are."
11,"I am not big into playing games. but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand. I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic. You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. no complicated instructions. It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults (all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it). The games only take about 20 minutes so it isn't a big time commitment either. To me it's like a dominoes/Uno combo. but more fun and more variety of play. Very fun. excellent game. not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews."
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
12,"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system. the Playstation. Still. I have never grown tired of playing levels. which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack. the jungle is incredibly lush. and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder."
12,"What's amazing about how great this game is...well. it's that it does not rely on insane graphics. large amounts of memory. lightning-quick processing speeds. or mind-blowing sound.In fact. this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin. suck you in. and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2. etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one."
11,"Bananagrams is a brilliant game. It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble (the interminable length of some games or turns!) by making speed an issue. You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids (older for sure) to play as well. We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family. Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one. If you are at all interested in word games. you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round. So simple! Perfect. get it! Wish I had thought of it..."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
12,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use. even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse. U have to be in direct light to see the screen. and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point. biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use. though. and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time. and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool. and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly. in fact. that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible. and the port stays clear."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
12,"Like I've said before. Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996. the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays. every other game is a 3d adventure 'in the vain of Tomb Raider'.The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action. great graphics which still hold up today. and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending. and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?While TR 2 is the best in the series. this one will be the most remembered.Story: 6/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Fun: 8/10"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
11,"Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up. I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking. which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things. but accuracy is key. which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring. can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!"
10,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job. it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much. do more. and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
10,"This sander is very high quaility. and will last for years. It is very powerful. you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander. because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great. it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable. ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust. just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
12,"Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet. but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man. Dig-Dug. Galaxian. Phozon. and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun. but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall. I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
10,"I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem. I had very poor results.  Using solid wood. however. resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
10,"You'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago. I use this saw every day. I cut and/or cut and cope large base. large case. and large crown even 16&quot; bullnose shelving on custom homes. I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut. still dead on. I even straight cut cope joints. and the blade follows the bevel perfectly. In some houses the preference is Oak. and the cuts are knifejoint. Everyone I work with has one. swears by them. Just as good as the day I got it. It is not stationary either. it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer. I couldn't begin to count. even in a day. how many times the base has swiveled. rails have slid. bevel has been changed. and the saw has started.and it's just as accurate as the day I got it. I make my living with this saw. I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
11,"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy. sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different. fun scenery. which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book. and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers. and that's a couple years down the road."
10,"I own a home remodeling business. and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as 'chop' saws for rough framing duties; however. when I need to do finish work or flooring. I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid. durable and very accurate. and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure. 10'. 12' and 15' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings. but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility. portability. and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"
11,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around. add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality. stickers can be pulled off. moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift. party favor and holiday present."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
11,"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you &#34;get it&#34; you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games. but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know. game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper &#34;in your head&#34; like I did. then you will LOVE this!"
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
12,"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure. thriller. problem solving. and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours. but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game."
12,"This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good. and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before. and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me. you will get your money's worth! Good graphics. excellent sound scores. huge worlds. and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority. even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through. and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
11,"This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme.  This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination.  For avid fans of the Simpsons. the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character (even the obscure ones) to get the answer right.  The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together.  If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans. you won't be disappointed buying this."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
12,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game. i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube. so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
10,"I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact. it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
12,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics.better realism. and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good. after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
12,"When the day I got unreal and tried it. I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was. the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game. you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):VortexRikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali. then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj. you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel. you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real. no it's not. it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating. breath taking missions. where you fight for life to survive. collecting itemslike defenses and weapons. travel through temples. facilitys. castles. bases. mountians. journey through what napali has to offer. and end up and the skaarj mothers ship. confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone!I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!"
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration. thinking. and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair. fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board. the style of the cards. and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
11,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth. the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well. he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player. I still want to join the group. but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes. 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
10,"Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered. i'm going for number 6.  I should give up. up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt. direct from Delta. was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places. almost beyond recognition.Needless to say. I'm VERY disappointed."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
11,"My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games. Scrabble in particular. my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously. we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players. a single round can take quite awhile."
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
11,"This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these. they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult. you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy."
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
10,"This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package. I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well. adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly. now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
10,"I have owned this drill for about a year.  There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this 'old school' power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful. smooth. not heavy. balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too 'old school'...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious. Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar. that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
10,"Light. almost too light; and relatively quiet.  Not as agressive as I would like. even with 60 grit.  Dust collection bag still obtrusive and tends to spew extra fine dust into ones face if the unit is held at a ninety degree angle.  The angular design makes for a secure fit upside down in a bench vise so one can hand feed smaller pieces for shaping.  I rarely use a belt sanders and then only to hog off amounts to then use the RO sander.Bottom line:  I love Bosh anything so if I had the money I would have spent extra to get a heavier duty machine by Bosch."
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
10,"Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272. This gun is fast and reliable! The 'dial-up' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters. The gun is light; powerful; well balanced; and rugged. For the average homeowner's drywall needs. this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun (which can be very pricey). because I hate dragging around a cord. But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun. get it. you won't be sorry."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
11,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2. they have moved on. so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality. made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times. then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
10,"This is my pick for the best RO sander. It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand. The dust collection is great. The little  canister is easy to dump and you're back at it in no time. Variable speed  is a must for fine work. You don't always want full power. like when you  just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture. You can dial  it down real low if you want to. This coupled to the pad control feature  means no ruined work. ever. I use this sander far more than my Dewalt.  Bosch and Makita RO sanders"
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
10,"This is a well-made product. and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time. it's probably worth picking one of these up.  I've been using mine for about three years. and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).  I used the original insert from the saw as a template. rough cut the plywood a band saw. and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together.  A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"They are not made in the USA anymore. but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then."
11,"This game has great strategy. a great theme and is easy to learn.  There are however two big drawbacks.1. It is very extreme. the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin.  They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either. you're pretty much done for.2. Because of the aforementioned drawback. there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning.  This is ok if you're an experienced gamer but it'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it's their first time so be careful."
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
11,"What can I say that other parents and grandparents haven't already said in their reviews? This is a fantastic book...Since it is fall/early winter now. my daughter's tooties are covered up so we use our hands. She loves this book. She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages. Yes. it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books (Goodnight Moon-type) and shorter books like this one...so for us the length is perfect!We've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months. Very sturdy. high quality. I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas. I'm also buying Little Hands Love. I'd picked up 'Feet' on an Xmas shopping whim. I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today!"
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
11,"this is a great filler. You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home. There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts. have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn. or meet specific timeline requirements. The third option is the core of the game. There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table. Each card represents a year. Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand. These are called Linchpin cards. Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history. What happens if Lincoln isn't assassinated? Or the Challenger never blew up? Each change in history has a ripple effect. Events in future years can be changes. creating paradoxes in time. These paradoxes can be &#34;patched&#34; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction. fun mechanics. and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play. this is a great choice."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
11,"Recently. I purchased a couple of sets of magnetic poetry for family.  The Little Box of Sin was one of them.  Through my purchase. I have learned that magnetic poetry sets that are under 100 magnets are pretty useless.  If you don't have other magnetic poetry pieces at home. the sentences you will be able to make will be boring.  Seventy-two magnetic pieces is not enough - there is not a vast selection of words.  The set had words like wine. pleasure. greed. lust. love. wicked and  excess and supplemental words like out. us. all. to. and is.  The set lacked lacked words like bed. chocolate. him. her.  I found the  magnets to be hard to break apart.  The tin is nice. but it is small.  If I had seen this set prior to purchase. it would have never made it into my shopping cart.Made in the United States."
11,"This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall. it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old. though. Luckily. most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
10,"This drill has great torque. it will twist your hand off if you use the the old 'hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit' method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!This drill will handle anything you throw at it. but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!"
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
10,"Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking. It has yet to fail me. The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room.  I have moved more into working (small furniture) and still love it.  Just recently the electric brake was intermittent. and I went back to the manual. Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum. and it's fine again. I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts. It's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length. It's a trial and error process. and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
10,"Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router.  Fits up to the plunge base only.  Will not fit up to the fixed base.  The fixed base has its own model edge guide.  However. this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide. In addition. it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after (3) months of use.Holds its setting very well. no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However. chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
11,"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said. this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like 'meaningless' conversations or activities. then this will not be for you. For a large party. this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun. relax. enjoy it.  It's only a game."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
11,"This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train. and someone else takes it. which ruins your entire game plan.Overall. it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play. so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
11,"This is a great way to play hangman. No wasting of paper and it's so solid it can be used anywhere. My six year old grandson likes to play this in church. The only drawback is the snapping sound of the 'tiles' as they are turned over. I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the 'tiles'. That doesn't work on the printed side. but I'm going to try some clear rubber 'dots' for those sides. Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise. but the younger ones have a harder time if they aren't very patient. If noise isn't a factor. then you'll like this a lot."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
11,"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted. but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
10,"I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed. 50% or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand. I use my tools hard. but with care and maintenance. and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit. This 3107 DVS is new but I don't expect it to be any different. I don't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac. Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old. So much said! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
10,"I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway. and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin. it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!"
10,"I. Love. My. Fein tool.  It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done. in renovating a 100+ year old home.  Some have found the blades don't last well but they have for me.  I'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but. considering how much time and aggravation they've saved. it is well worth it.  I don't do that kind of cutting  with this flush cut blade. of course. but it is one of those tools that. when you need it. you need it and there's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile. that's for sure."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
10,"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters. missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate. it has to be the best 10' CSMS on the market! Get one new. get one used -- but get one!"
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
10,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up. Mirka was recommended. so I decided to give it a try. especially since a 50-pack costs $17. vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks. there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper. I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
10,"Overall this is a nice product. but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately. I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton. and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64' thickness of the lamination. I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
12,"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
12,"I was a vivid gamer back in the day. and Mario was always one of my all time favorites. I have long since moved away from the video game scene. but now and then I play the classics on the PC. And when I played this version. I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA. The graphics are the same. the gameplay is the same. the sound is the same. but there is new extras and bonus stuff. a pathway to choose. multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. (1) game ever! Even better then Mario All Stars (snes) version!!!"
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby .

3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
12,"To be perfectly frank. the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase. the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So. if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price. get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
12,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did. all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap. kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19."
8,"That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
12,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda. have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking. I remember how fun and exciting it was. and it was so good. because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game. please get it. it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years. you too can think of what a great game Zelda was. but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2. but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
12,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is. but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d. others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay. but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago. but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that. it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it. don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
12,"The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading. but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur. Starmie. Vulpix. Vileplume. Articuno. Electabuzz. Ponyta. Gloom. Tangela. Lickitung. Mewtwo. Chansey.

4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4.

12,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old. and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities. and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time. obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative. or well designed. but it is classic.  In the end. and as a fan of the Alien series. I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
12,"A very fun game that has to do with teamwork! I don't understand why they didn't make it co op. but it's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes. It's also one of my favorite Sonic character's debut! E-123 Omega! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game. I don't know why they had to kick him out when he's a member of the Chaotix. And shouldn't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix. too? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles. and. although the graphics aren't PS3 amazing. they're good for a PS2 game. The game's good for a Sonic fan at any age. you don't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game (although I'm both ^_^)."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
10,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine.  But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars.  Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard.  All in all. a disappointemnt.  I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign.  Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"

4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
12,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now. but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it 'E'. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game. but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked. but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
12,"The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior. finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games. such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64. I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of .... a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."

10,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box. the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself. get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal. and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
10,"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth. it is powerful. it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean. buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
12,"No doubt. the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system. and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels. and is very challenging. but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get. but once you do. it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall. you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
10,"This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions. or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff. get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)"
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
10,"It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the 'Best in Class'.  Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6.  What sold me was the metal gears. nice feel. good trigger. obvious to the point of 'art' quality. and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art. it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
12,"I havn't played Myst yet. but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics. great sound. great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world. but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all. WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy. puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
10,"I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw. I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?"
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
10,"Once it is set up. it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up.  While the setup is not difficult. it is time consuming.  For me the plastic storage box is completely useless.  The box is cheap and in order to be  used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled.  Also. the  plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version.  The part number I received is 17-924 but  it doesn't resemble the picture  on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box.  It took me about  20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now  that I've done it.  Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling  operation.  To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."
3,"When is there a reason good enough to expand your family.  Dan is in love with his wife. Elle.  They have an amazing relationship. a great sex life. and a comfortable home.  So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.  But how would a baby fit in when she doesn&#8217;t feel that she is where she wants to beIs Dan&#8217;s love and understanding reason enough?  Read the story.

3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
10,"This scroll saw is great:- High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!- A bit heavy for portability. but that enhances its stability.- Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws (top and bottom). no tool is required.- All user controls - on/off sw. blade tensioner. speed controller - are in the front and &quot;user friendly&quot;.- It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration. unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table. (To be fair. the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt.) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape; it will work but nothing to write home about. Maybe I should have saved the $50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
10,"I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
12,"This type of RPG was easy to master. because at the start of the game. I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game. but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type. it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise. this game's a blast to play. with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
11,"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other."
11,"This is a fantastic game! Seriously. I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did. My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format. Once we brought it out and we started playing I couldn't get enough of it. In all honesty. you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good. or you can have terrible rolls and lose early. but the game is still very fun and exciting! Turns don't take very long and so there isn't that much downtime. It's fast. fun. fairly in-depth. strategic. back-stabbing. and awesome!"
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
12,"First. get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye. Mario Party. Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics. Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see. Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp. Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun. but only in groups."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
11,"There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game. We came across this game while staying with my Uncle.  My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked.  I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered.  As soon as it got to our house we took it out. had some friends over and played it with them.  They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it.  We play this game at least once a week.  We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it yet."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
11,"Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers. who know how games do. and should. work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin. they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a 'build your own board' board game. Meaning that every time you play it. the game will not be the same. This lends to multiple replays. and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time. not all view it as a draw back. Few games can hold attention of players. constantly change. and live up to expectations over long prolonged games. Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game. will love Munchkin Quest. and it's original line. Munchkin Card Game."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
11,"Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really). it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice. gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose. you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise. the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game. but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall. a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
12,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago. Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards. but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York). and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic. this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
11,"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them. then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books. its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
12,"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics. levels. and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game. this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer. a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer. a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives. and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score. gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
12,"I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color.  if your buying a game boy color you won't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
11,"For the first time in the 10 Days series. you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
11,"My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle.  The puzzle has 24 large. thick pieces which were easy to fit together.  The puzzle and box are sturdy. and the box has a convenient rope handle.  The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have. and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores.  As you can tell from the box. the animals are more cartoonish than realistic. but pleasant enough.  Both sides. even the back. of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well.  Recommended."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
11,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product. the programmable Rover. that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product. as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However. now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review. even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review..."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"We purchased our 'Elf' after everyone was talking about it at preschool. Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids' behavior (We have a 4.3 and 1 year old) It wasn't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble. My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy. When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on. It really works!! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning. We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we don't read the book. My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it's a great idea and it really works with our kids."
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
12,"The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche. They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy. you wont find that out until later in the game. I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made.!"
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
11,"This is a fun game. and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number. no matter what the color. be the player that loses makes for some great 'take that' blocking opportunities. Also. for parents of children. my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also. the box is designed well to house all the components. which are also very well made."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
12,"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics. cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money. but of course. I wait till the games are 'old hat' and buy them cheaper.The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope. I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal. but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars. I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game. as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the 'extras'. that should have been in the game to begin with."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
11,"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well. as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion. Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game. adding more challenging but more rewarding quests. new lord cards. and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun. and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game. this is a must have expansion. and a great value for the price."
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
12,"This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very. very. hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful."
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
11,"So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing. or another rubbing it in as a bad winner. etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that. does it well. and comes with TONS of minis. missions. etc. That said. it's designed very well. the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions. but for some reason unlike some other games we own. the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something. but that's just my 2 cents."
12,"This game is really good. It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly. turn invisible and go through certain types of walls. and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64. you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks."
3,"When Alexandra 'Sasha' DeStephano is summoned to a special meeting to appear in front of her elders. she has no idea she is being placed into a power struggle.  She soon finds herself promoted to Tiger Queen.Colton 'Cole' Reyes. a rogue alpha. steps in to help her.  He thinks she is their only hope to bring new leadership to the pack.  In order to protect her and get through the night he suggests she pretend to be his mate.  However. Sasha does not want to keep pretending.Tiger by the Tail is sexy and fast-paced with the alpha hero in an awkward position trying to get her pack back on track and fighting the current leadership.  Cole and Sasha's chemistry is immediate and they soon realize what they mean to each other.  I loved Sasha's wicked humor and Cole is a wonderful alpha and a perfect match for Sasha.  Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
12,"Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over. Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game. Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth. The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so. those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games. will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
11,"Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players. Three or more is ideal. Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill. You may keep one route. or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to &#34;buy&#34; your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much. we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
11,"This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it. especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"
11,"I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it.  After two plays. she decided that. nope. it was not her thing;  she didn't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I'm not sure why -- buying & selling. etc. do not usually interest me but this game is great fun.  Elves. dwarves. gnomes. a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game.  It has one of the best rule books I've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
11,"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling 'Speed Scrabble' for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn. he yells 'Draw 2!' and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles. like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people. it does help to have two sets of tiles. of course."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."
3,"This was a book of many wonderful Indian fairy tales. It includes tales both of a 'classical' fairy tale style and ones that are moralistic folktales instead.

7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"If they made more games like this. I'd be a pauper. Intelligent. funny. easy to use. easy to solve. and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking. gorgeous. well-written. and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed. so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble. though."
11,"Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles.  I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they don't line it up right and can't get the lid on. The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle 'At the Zoo' is a fun open interpretation.  It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place.  My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend 'At the Zoo' or any of Mudpuppy's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
11,"For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game.  My son is 7.  Fortunately. there are Basic and Advanced rules.  I found the Basic rules were sufficiently &#34;difficult&#34; and understandable.  We play with just three players. but it's easy to see how more players = more fun.  I happen to drive a manual transmission (and 6-speed to boot. just like the game) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself. with the only the sound of tumbling dice.  Wonderful."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
12,"Ya know. I remember playing this game as a kid.I couldn't find this game anywhere. and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version. so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline. and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones. then you'd love this game.Pros (or cons):Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons (or pros):Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1. so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally. I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.Also. if anyone buys this game. then I have to tell you this: Please. if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>"
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
11,"What cute graphics on this puzzle! My animal loving girls (3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion. This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds!"
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
12,"This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game. not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much. it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
12,"posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great. u may think u should just rent it. but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio. and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line. great wepons. great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this."
11,"We bought 3 new games for family game nights :)  We saw episodes of Will Wheaton's youtube show. TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun (Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two).  Out of the three. this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use :)  Phrases. a song. a tune. a movie or book title...  It is a good test for one's knowledge. too (which is good for my kid hehe)...  We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge.  I hope they make expansions for it!"
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
11,"This isn't a game to sit down and play with your friends or family. It gets very chaotic and isn't much fun. But as an ice-breaker at a party while people are going about other things at the same time I expect it would be fun.The idea of the game is to try to get the most beads by finding people that fit a certain specification or getting people to do or say certain things. Everyone steals beads from everyone else and the player with the most beads at the end of the time (you can set the time for whatever you want) wins. The great thing about this game is if you wanted to you could easily buy more beads to play with.If you are looking for an ice-breaker game. I would recommend this. Otherwise you might be disappointed."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
12,"It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying 'duh'.  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!"
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
11,"Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough. that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything. but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing. so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
12,"this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
12,"first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun. second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU!!!!and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S. the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares .HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO.OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD"
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
12,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS. SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS. OR I should REALLY say is. &quot;Beanie Baby&quot;. and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY. this game should surplus 5 stars. I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1.000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly. I WANTED TO SEE PIT &quot;KID ICARUS&quot; IN THIS GAME. MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask. ask. ask! PRETTY SOON. THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND &quot;DAI-BIYESSO. DAI-BIYE!&quot; (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
10,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting. it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to 'try' to use. the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line. the way its supposed to be."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
12,"I'm what gamers call a 'Zelda Veteran' . I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging. different and fun to play.In this one. Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider. the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda. the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble. and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi. a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures. Link will learn spells. be swallowed by a huge fish. and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
10,"I bought this sander to replace a 3&#34; x 18&#34; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
11,"This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn.  Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays. which keeps it interesting. A great game for all ages. even if all of them don't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box.  The yellow is more chartreuse (yuck) and the orange is not very bright.  If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table. they're not visually very acute.  Our table has overhead lighting. so it's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile. as described."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
10,"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags. they are fine.  About 95% have no problem. but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight. they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these. but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers. but they don't. so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
10,"Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet.  This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss. and is lightweight and easy to use.  Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4' worm drive. so I grab the 5 1/2' skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size. and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way. it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet. go back to the kitchen."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
10,"I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit. but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle. you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what. this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
11,"This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old.  The Consensus from everyone was that it wouldn't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat.  The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do.  Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads.  This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
11,"There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason. This game is very fun and simple to teach new people. I've taught many of my family members how to play and they've all enjoyed it. I still need to purchase a few of the expansions. which would really open the game up a lot. but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby. you can't beat this starter set. The mechanics are super fun and streamlined. You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game. I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles. I highly recommend this game."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
10,"I have used one of these for five or six years now. It is very strong and very tuff; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great. I use two of them constantly. but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill. strong but not too heavy or bulky; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such. when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong."

1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
11,"Intended for 4 to 12 players. Party Gras encourages interaction with family. friends. and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party. celebration. etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill. thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.The idea is very good. but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think 'Did they just put that in the card?' And. that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.  If you want outrageous. ridiculous. but still fun action cards. I recommendQuelf Board Game.Overall. a game that had lots of potential. but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
10,"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good. I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also. this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
10,"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin. which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps.I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth. but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
10,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit.  It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!!  As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy. well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw.  It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so.  I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744.  If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
10,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice. neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising. it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience. but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
12,"The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color. The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games.  This time. Link doesn't have to save the world. but rather himself!  While Link is sailing on the ocean. his boat is struck by a lightning bolt. causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water. he lands on an island. But since he has landed on the island. all he can think of is getting off of it! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens.  This game has an excellent game play. and story-line! It is worth every penny!"
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
11,"I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures. so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However. for some reason. she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures. which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time. because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea. but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
11,"It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the 'rules' no one was really engaged in the 'play' aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an 'icebreaker'/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly. not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously. this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a 'party'."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
10,"If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and &#34;excellent&#34; joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt. you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer. eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put. these are the industry standard for a reason."
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
12,"With The Minish Cap coming out soon. and looking to be another disappointment (I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it. but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe). the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic. The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer. The graphics aren't very good; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes. but the game is so good one will hardly notice. The sound effects are pretty poor. but. thankfully. there's always the music to compensate for that...and what good music.It feels like ALttP. looks like it. plays like it. and is second only to that excellent SNES game."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
11,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also. the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
12,"When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid. I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck. I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story. an interesting environment. and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion. it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game. don't consider any longer. GET IT."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
10,"We have tried all types of blades. And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders! In 10' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight. we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 'Ultimate Crosscutting' blade! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours don't skimp on your crosscut blades! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud!And Fillet Your Wood!"
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
12,"For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated. this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play. although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too. in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and. in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or. indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission. or do the mission without support. as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs. and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
10,"I've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades.  I use them on my Ridgid 10' table saw. 10' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12' sliding miter saw. This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods.  I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades.  Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my 'best in class' award.  The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker.  To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website:  Life After 50--One Man's Perspective.  The link below will take you to my homepage where you'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL:  [...]"
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
10,"Overall a great sander. I have dropped.stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
12,"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all. the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store. buy it. You will have a good time with this game!"
12,"Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels.and don't forget our stars of the game.a brave.kicking butt little girl.Carrie.And a brave young whipping man.Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house.Dracula's castle.the forest.and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!"
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"&quot;Breath of Fire 3&quot; is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good. and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character. and then later in the game. you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre."
12,"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made. Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too). its rich. colorful and very addicting. The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!). and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous. I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement. its just really cool. this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player. Im serious if you dont have this. your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!"
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
12,"This game is super hard the first time around. Then. when you beat it. and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour. because almost all of it is puzzles. so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights. where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest. funnest fight is in the very beggining. when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units. and better levels. this game would be worth buying. but as it is it is not all that good."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
6,"Avery Clean Edge Business Cards - #28878These business card blanks are designed specifically for use with an ink jet printer. Each sheet contains ten standard size 2' x 3.5' cards - eight sheets to a package (80 cards total). The sheets can be printed on both sides if required. The paper stock is a nice. heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel. Avery's Clean Edge feature allows the finished cards to literally 'snap' apart by bending the sheets backward. The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [...] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site. I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps. but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended."
12,"Ah. Spyro! Released in 1998 for the PS1. Spyro is the first entry of many. [Although. only the first three were any good. because the newer ones were owned by an poor company.]Graphics: 9/10: Horrible by today's standards. but very good by 1998 standards. Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10: Pretty catchy. nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound: 8/10: Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10: You control Spyro. the PO'd dragon. through many worlds. There he must collect gems. rescue dragons. fight enimies. bosses. and other dangers. and also use his trademark flame and charge moves. This game is a bit easy. but it's very entartaining.The game costs about 10$ about now. so buy it!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
12,"This game is great. You go through 5 different time portales. Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss. What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference. Oh! one more thing. press up. up. down. down. left. right. left. right. square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon.  This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation"
12,"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
11,"This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time.  In addition to placing your workers. when you place them. an amount of time has to pass.  Once enough time has passed. one of your oldest generation of workers dies.  They're removed from the game. and depending on what job they were doing at the time. they're either placed into the history book of the village or they're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village. by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village. by traveling. and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book. or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It's a fairly tight worker placement game. with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
12,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics. use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake."
12,"I have never managed to beat the game. can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours.  My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation.  She was getting frustrated with Crash. until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play.  Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first. you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want.  Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle).T.T.T.X.S(square).T.T.T.T.S.X.T.O.T.T.T.O.S.T.X.X.X.X. Maybe it is cheating. but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game. it makes playing it more fun!"
11,"Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other. The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused. It was sort of anticlimactic. It can take some time as you read each card (CAREFULLY) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds. And then suddenly the game is over. The second time we played things started to click and by the third game. we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it. Mind you. we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards. Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions. Reading carefully is crucial to this game. I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well."
12,"I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well. it was hard to locate where you were going. unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately. the writers expected us to know as well."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
11,"I'm not traditional. didn't grow up that way and have not lived that way...however. a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition.  So glad I did.  My daughter loves. Niko (that's what we named our elf) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night.  Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night.  We love it and so glad we purchased it.  When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email.  It's really very cute and creative.  The included book explains the story and tradition.  Great find. and I recommend!"
10,"I am a weekend woodwarrior.  Wanted a nice sliding miter saw.  Looked at all of them. fondled a few and them. then found this one on sale through Amazon.  This is a nice saw.  Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day.  Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square.  Adjustments were quick and easy. Very easy to use.  Manual is great. Dust collection is not that great. but it wasn't with my non-sliding miter either.  It's the nature of this type of machine.  What was my old miter saw?  A Bosch 12' that was stolen from my garage.  Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff.  Would buy this one again in a heart beat."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
11,"I'm a mother. trainer. and in-home childcare provider. so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success.  I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another 'homework' book to do.  I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they're presented; the price is great. too.  For $2. it's worth it.For all of my kids. I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool (or Kindergarten. 1st grade. etc.. depending on their age).  It's only $13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level.  I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare's Writing Center."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
12,"When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end. doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore. But with the recent purchase of a n64. i have again. found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful. fun cheats that it offers. This game changed the way we play games. totally. It is still one of the best games I own. right next to the newest xbox 360 games."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
10,"I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed. the action is smooth. and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw. I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita. I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks. no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to. but once you've used it awhile. you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
11,"I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed. another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
10,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708. the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction. particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece. but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides. removing for steep beveling. etc)."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
10,"If you own Unisaw. or any other large heavy machine for that matter. you really should consider getting a mobile base.  Delta's bases are strong. sturdy. look good and are very stable.  When I upgraded to a Unisaw. I also  bought the mobile base.  My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than  my contractors saw used to be.  With a quick step on the foot lever it  effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved  very easily.  A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the  saw and it rests solidly on 4 points. making it very stable.  This design  of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and  manouver.  If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was. put your  machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less  space and your shop will seem larger."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
12,"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game. Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said. I liked the characters. Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun: Single-Player: C+ Multi-player: B+Sound: B-Characters: B+Controls: A-Overall: B"
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced. yes. but you get Darth Vader as a pilot. and he is worth every point.  The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader. and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader (TIE Advanced) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
11,"This game is pretty fun for young children. in fact we did play it three times when we first opened it. However. it can be very hard to win the key is to get a high roll. If you ae unlucky like I was to roll low number you are out of luck a lot on this game. It is also hard to move all the way over to the other side of the board so that you can try the other 'mini games' there were a couple that seemed really fun but I never got to try them because my piece started way over on one side and they were on the other. I like the concept and who doesn't love Rudolph but I really think they could have made it a much more fun game."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
10,"Milwaukee. again. has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters. although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
11,"I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative 'deck-building' mechanic of that game.  I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone.  I usually don't buy games unless I've played them before so I know what to expect. but I decided to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did!  Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme.  The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent.  The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion. but it makes for a more involved experience.  I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard. Recommended!"
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
12,"Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example. you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself. although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in. like 40 Lines. on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top. Marathon. on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top. or Ultra. where you see how good you can do. except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
10,"My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result. puts his power tools through hell.  He's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s.  It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita.  I've never been sorry.  I'm not a pro. but I certainly enjoy having a powerful. accurate saw when I need to make home repairs.  I haven't found anything I can't slice through with this little monster.  I've had it several years and it works like a new tool.  The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard. thick lumber and has the added homeowner's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws.  There's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever."
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
12,"For all gamers out there. this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan"
12,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out. some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system. I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier. this is an early title for the N64. you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games. ignore it if your looking for the best."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
10,"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits. but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2' size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table. this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4' collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly. of course. and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers. in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers. you need one for backup in any case"
10,"Great sander. ample power. belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However. one time during use. I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up. wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing. and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired. but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord. and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that. the tool has performed flawlessly."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time. but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64. and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said. this is one of the most innovative. most fun. and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE. there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game. and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100"
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
12,"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot. the comedy. the political intrigues. an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was. whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again. you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew. think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell. this game's for you!"
10,"I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with 'drill'. Like . you look in the dictionary for 'Drill' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong. unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly. this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong. Be carefull."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
10,"When I put this blade on my old skil saw. I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me. If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all. try switching to this blade and see how it should be done! I've been cutting some 1/4&quot; oak finish beaded paneling and I don't even have to turn it face down. My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up. Not this blade. I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went. Not a mark to be seen. Great blade!"
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
10,"This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are."
11,"I am not big into playing games. but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand. I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic. You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. no complicated instructions. It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults (all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it). The games only take about 20 minutes so it isn't a big time commitment either. To me it's like a dominoes/Uno combo. but more fun and more variety of play. Very fun. excellent game. not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews."
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
12,"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system. the Playstation. Still. I have never grown tired of playing levels. which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack. the jungle is incredibly lush. and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder."
12,"What's amazing about how great this game is...well. it's that it does not rely on insane graphics. large amounts of memory. lightning-quick processing speeds. or mind-blowing sound.In fact. this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin. suck you in. and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2. etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one."
11,"Bananagrams is a brilliant game. It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble (the interminable length of some games or turns!) by making speed an issue. You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids (older for sure) to play as well. We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family. Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one. If you are at all interested in word games. you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round. So simple! Perfect. get it! Wish I had thought of it..."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
12,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use. even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse. U have to be in direct light to see the screen. and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point. biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use. though. and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time. and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool. and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly. in fact. that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible. and the port stays clear."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
12,"Like I've said before. Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996. the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays. every other game is a 3d adventure 'in the vain of Tomb Raider'.The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action. great graphics which still hold up today. and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending. and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?While TR 2 is the best in the series. this one will be the most remembered.Story: 6/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Fun: 8/10"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
11,"Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up. I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking. which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things. but accuracy is key. which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring. can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!"
10,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job. it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much. do more. and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
10,"This sander is very high quaility. and will last for years. It is very powerful. you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander. because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great. it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable. ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust. just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
12,"Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet. but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man. Dig-Dug. Galaxian. Phozon. and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun. but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall. I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
10,"I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem. I had very poor results.  Using solid wood. however. resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
10,"You'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago. I use this saw every day. I cut and/or cut and cope large base. large case. and large crown even 16&quot; bullnose shelving on custom homes. I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut. still dead on. I even straight cut cope joints. and the blade follows the bevel perfectly. In some houses the preference is Oak. and the cuts are knifejoint. Everyone I work with has one. swears by them. Just as good as the day I got it. It is not stationary either. it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer. I couldn't begin to count. even in a day. how many times the base has swiveled. rails have slid. bevel has been changed. and the saw has started.and it's just as accurate as the day I got it. I make my living with this saw. I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
11,"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy. sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different. fun scenery. which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book. and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers. and that's a couple years down the road."
10,"I own a home remodeling business. and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as 'chop' saws for rough framing duties; however. when I need to do finish work or flooring. I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid. durable and very accurate. and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure. 10'. 12' and 15' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings. but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility. portability. and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"
11,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around. add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality. stickers can be pulled off. moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift. party favor and holiday present."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
11,"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you &#34;get it&#34; you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games. but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know. game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper &#34;in your head&#34; like I did. then you will LOVE this!"
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
12,"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure. thriller. problem solving. and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours. but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game."
12,"This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good. and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before. and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me. you will get your money's worth! Good graphics. excellent sound scores. huge worlds. and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority. even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through. and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
11,"This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme.  This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination.  For avid fans of the Simpsons. the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character (even the obscure ones) to get the answer right.  The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together.  If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans. you won't be disappointed buying this."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
12,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game. i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube. so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
10,"I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact. it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
12,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics.better realism. and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good. after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
12,"When the day I got unreal and tried it. I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was. the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game. you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):VortexRikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali. then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj. you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel. you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real. no it's not. it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating. breath taking missions. where you fight for life to survive. collecting itemslike defenses and weapons. travel through temples. facilitys. castles. bases. mountians. journey through what napali has to offer. and end up and the skaarj mothers ship. confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone!I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!"
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration. thinking. and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair. fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board. the style of the cards. and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
11,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth. the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well. he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player. I still want to join the group. but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes. 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
10,"Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered. i'm going for number 6.  I should give up. up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt. direct from Delta. was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places. almost beyond recognition.Needless to say. I'm VERY disappointed."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
11,"My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games. Scrabble in particular. my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously. we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players. a single round can take quite awhile."
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
11,"This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these. they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult. you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy."
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
10,"This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package. I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well. adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly. now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
10,"I have owned this drill for about a year.  There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this 'old school' power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful. smooth. not heavy. balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too 'old school'...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious. Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar. that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
10,"Light. almost too light; and relatively quiet.  Not as agressive as I would like. even with 60 grit.  Dust collection bag still obtrusive and tends to spew extra fine dust into ones face if the unit is held at a ninety degree angle.  The angular design makes for a secure fit upside down in a bench vise so one can hand feed smaller pieces for shaping.  I rarely use a belt sanders and then only to hog off amounts to then use the RO sander.Bottom line:  I love Bosh anything so if I had the money I would have spent extra to get a heavier duty machine by Bosch."
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
10,"Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272. This gun is fast and reliable! The 'dial-up' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters. The gun is light; powerful; well balanced; and rugged. For the average homeowner's drywall needs. this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun (which can be very pricey). because I hate dragging around a cord. But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun. get it. you won't be sorry."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
11,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2. they have moved on. so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality. made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times. then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
10,"This is my pick for the best RO sander. It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand. The dust collection is great. The little  canister is easy to dump and you're back at it in no time. Variable speed  is a must for fine work. You don't always want full power. like when you  just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture. You can dial  it down real low if you want to. This coupled to the pad control feature  means no ruined work. ever. I use this sander far more than my Dewalt.  Bosch and Makita RO sanders"
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
10,"This is a well-made product. and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time. it's probably worth picking one of these up.  I've been using mine for about three years. and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).  I used the original insert from the saw as a template. rough cut the plywood a band saw. and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together.  A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"They are not made in the USA anymore. but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then."
11,"This game has great strategy. a great theme and is easy to learn.  There are however two big drawbacks.1. It is very extreme. the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin.  They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either. you're pretty much done for.2. Because of the aforementioned drawback. there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning.  This is ok if you're an experienced gamer but it'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it's their first time so be careful."
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
11,"What can I say that other parents and grandparents haven't already said in their reviews? This is a fantastic book...Since it is fall/early winter now. my daughter's tooties are covered up so we use our hands. She loves this book. She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages. Yes. it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books (Goodnight Moon-type) and shorter books like this one...so for us the length is perfect!We've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months. Very sturdy. high quality. I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas. I'm also buying Little Hands Love. I'd picked up 'Feet' on an Xmas shopping whim. I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today!"
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
11,"this is a great filler. You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home. There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts. have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn. or meet specific timeline requirements. The third option is the core of the game. There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table. Each card represents a year. Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand. These are called Linchpin cards. Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history. What happens if Lincoln isn't assassinated? Or the Challenger never blew up? Each change in history has a ripple effect. Events in future years can be changes. creating paradoxes in time. These paradoxes can be &#34;patched&#34; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction. fun mechanics. and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play. this is a great choice."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
11,"Recently. I purchased a couple of sets of magnetic poetry for family.  The Little Box of Sin was one of them.  Through my purchase. I have learned that magnetic poetry sets that are under 100 magnets are pretty useless.  If you don't have other magnetic poetry pieces at home. the sentences you will be able to make will be boring.  Seventy-two magnetic pieces is not enough - there is not a vast selection of words.  The set had words like wine. pleasure. greed. lust. love. wicked and  excess and supplemental words like out. us. all. to. and is.  The set lacked lacked words like bed. chocolate. him. her.  I found the  magnets to be hard to break apart.  The tin is nice. but it is small.  If I had seen this set prior to purchase. it would have never made it into my shopping cart.Made in the United States."
11,"This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall. it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old. though. Luckily. most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
10,"This drill has great torque. it will twist your hand off if you use the the old 'hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit' method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!This drill will handle anything you throw at it. but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!"
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
10,"Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking. It has yet to fail me. The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room.  I have moved more into working (small furniture) and still love it.  Just recently the electric brake was intermittent. and I went back to the manual. Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum. and it's fine again. I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts. It's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length. It's a trial and error process. and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
10,"Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router.  Fits up to the plunge base only.  Will not fit up to the fixed base.  The fixed base has its own model edge guide.  However. this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide. In addition. it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after (3) months of use.Holds its setting very well. no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However. chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
11,"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said. this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like 'meaningless' conversations or activities. then this will not be for you. For a large party. this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun. relax. enjoy it.  It's only a game."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
11,"This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train. and someone else takes it. which ruins your entire game plan.Overall. it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play. so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
11,"This is a great way to play hangman. No wasting of paper and it's so solid it can be used anywhere. My six year old grandson likes to play this in church. The only drawback is the snapping sound of the 'tiles' as they are turned over. I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the 'tiles'. That doesn't work on the printed side. but I'm going to try some clear rubber 'dots' for those sides. Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise. but the younger ones have a harder time if they aren't very patient. If noise isn't a factor. then you'll like this a lot."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
11,"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted. but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
10,"I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed. 50% or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand. I use my tools hard. but with care and maintenance. and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit. This 3107 DVS is new but I don't expect it to be any different. I don't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac. Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old. So much said! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
10,"I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway. and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin. it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!"
10,"I. Love. My. Fein tool.  It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done. in renovating a 100+ year old home.  Some have found the blades don't last well but they have for me.  I'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but. considering how much time and aggravation they've saved. it is well worth it.  I don't do that kind of cutting  with this flush cut blade. of course. but it is one of those tools that. when you need it. you need it and there's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile. that's for sure."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
10,"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters. missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate. it has to be the best 10' CSMS on the market! Get one new. get one used -- but get one!"
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
10,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up. Mirka was recommended. so I decided to give it a try. especially since a 50-pack costs $17. vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks. there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper. I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
10,"Overall this is a nice product. but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately. I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton. and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64' thickness of the lamination. I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
12,"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
12,"I was a vivid gamer back in the day. and Mario was always one of my all time favorites. I have long since moved away from the video game scene. but now and then I play the classics on the PC. And when I played this version. I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA. The graphics are the same. the gameplay is the same. the sound is the same. but there is new extras and bonus stuff. a pathway to choose. multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. (1) game ever! Even better then Mario All Stars (snes) version!!!"
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
12,"To be perfectly frank. the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase. the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So. if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price. get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
12,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did. all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap. kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19."
8,"That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
12,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda. have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking. I remember how fun and exciting it was. and it was so good. because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game. please get it. it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years. you too can think of what a great game Zelda was. but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2. but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
12,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is. but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d. others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay. but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago. but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that. it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it. don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
12,"The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading. but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur. Starmie. Vulpix. Vileplume. Articuno. Electabuzz. Ponyta. Gloom. Tangela. Lickitung. Mewtwo. Chansey.

4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
12,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old. and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities. and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time. obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative. or well designed. but it is classic.  In the end. and as a fan of the Alien series. I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
12,"A very fun game that has to do with teamwork! I don't understand why they didn't make it co op. but it's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes. It's also one of my favorite Sonic character's debut! E-123 Omega! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game. I don't know why they had to kick him out when he's a member of the Chaotix. And shouldn't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix. too? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles. and. although the graphics aren't PS3 amazing. they're good for a PS2 game. The game's good for a Sonic fan at any age. you don't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game (although I'm both ^_^)."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
10,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine.  But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars.  Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard.  All in all. a disappointemnt.  I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign.  Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
12,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now. but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it 'E'. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game. but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked. but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
12,"The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior. finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games. such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64. I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of .... a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."

10,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box. the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself. get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal. and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
10,"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth. it is powerful. it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean. buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
12,"No doubt. the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system. and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels. and is very challenging. but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get. but once you do. it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall. you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
10,"This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions. or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff. get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)"
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
10,"It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the 'Best in Class'.  Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6.  What sold me was the metal gears. nice feel. good trigger. obvious to the point of 'art' quality. and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art. it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
12,"I havn't played Myst yet. but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics. great sound. great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world. but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all. WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy. puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
10,"I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw. I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?"
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
10,"Once it is set up. it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up.  While the setup is not difficult. it is time consuming.  For me the plastic storage box is completely useless.  The box is cheap and in order to be  used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled.  Also. the  plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version.  The part number I received is 17-924 but  it doesn't resemble the picture  on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box.  It took me about  20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now  that I've done it.  Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling  operation.  To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."
3,"When is there a reason good enough to expand your family.  Dan is in love with his wife. Elle.  They have an amazing relationship. a great sex life. and a comfortable home.  So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.

3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
10,"This scroll saw is great:- High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!- A bit heavy for portability. but that enhances its stability.- Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws (top and bottom). no tool is required.- All user controls - on/off sw. blade tensioner. speed controller - are in the front and &quot;user friendly&quot;.- It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration. unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table. (To be fair. the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt.) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape; it will work but nothing to write home about. Maybe I should have saved the $50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
10,"I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
12,"This type of RPG was easy to master. because at the start of the game. I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game. but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type. it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise. this game's a blast to play. with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
11,"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other."
11,"This is a fantastic game! Seriously. I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did. My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format. Once we brought it out and we started playing I couldn't get enough of it. In all honesty. you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good. or you can have terrible rolls and lose early. but the game is still very fun and exciting! Turns don't take very long and so there isn't that much downtime. It's fast. fun. fairly in-depth. strategic. back-stabbing. and awesome!"
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
12,"First. get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye. Mario Party. Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics. Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see. Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp. Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun. but only in groups."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
11,"There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game. We came across this game while staying with my Uncle.  My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked.  I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered.  As soon as it got to our house we took it out. had some friends over and played it with them.  They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it.  We play this game at least once a week.  We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it yet."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
11,"Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers. who know how games do. and should. work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin. they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a 'build your own board' board game. Meaning that every time you play it. the game will not be the same. This lends to multiple replays. and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time. not all view it as a draw back. Few games can hold attention of players. constantly change. and live up to expectations over long prolonged games. Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game. will love Munchkin Quest. and it's original line. Munchkin Card Game."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
11,"Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really). it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice. gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose. you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise. the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game. but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall. a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
12,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago. Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards. but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York). and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic. this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
11,"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them. then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books. its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
12,"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics. levels. and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game. this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer. a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer. a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives. and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score. gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
12,"I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color.  if your buying a game boy color you won't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
11,"For the first time in the 10 Days series. you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
11,"My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle.  The puzzle has 24 large. thick pieces which were easy to fit together.  The puzzle and box are sturdy. and the box has a convenient rope handle.  The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have. and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores.  As you can tell from the box. the animals are more cartoonish than realistic. but pleasant enough.  Both sides. even the back. of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well.  Recommended."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
11,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product. the programmable Rover. that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product. as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However. now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review. even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review..."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"We purchased our 'Elf' after everyone was talking about it at preschool. Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids' behavior (We have a 4.3 and 1 year old) It wasn't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble. My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy. When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on. It really works!! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning. We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we don't read the book. My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it's a great idea and it really works with our kids."
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
12,"The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche. They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy. you wont find that out until later in the game. I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made.!"
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
11,"This is a fun game. and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number. no matter what the color. be the player that loses makes for some great 'take that' blocking opportunities. Also. for parents of children. my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also. the box is designed well to house all the components. which are also very well made."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
12,"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics. cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money. but of course. I wait till the games are 'old hat' and buy them cheaper.The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope. I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal. but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars. I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game. as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the 'extras'. that should have been in the game to begin with."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
11,"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well. as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion. Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game. adding more challenging but more rewarding quests. new lord cards. and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun. and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game. this is a must have expansion. and a great value for the price."
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
12,"This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very. very. hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful."
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
11,"So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing. or another rubbing it in as a bad winner. etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that. does it well. and comes with TONS of minis. missions. etc. That said. it's designed very well. the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions. but for some reason unlike some other games we own. the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something. but that's just my 2 cents."
12,"This game is really good. It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly. turn invisible and go through certain types of walls. and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64. you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks."
3,"When Alexandra 'Sasha' DeStephano is summoned to a special meeting to appear in front of her elders. she has no idea she is being placed into a power struggle.  She soon finds herself promoted to Tiger Queen.Colton 'Cole' Reyes. a rogue alpha. steps in to help her.  He thinks she is their only hope to bring new leadership to the pack.  In order to protect her and get through the night he suggests she pretend to be his mate.  However. Sasha does not want to keep pretending.Tiger by the Tail is sexy and fast-paced with the alpha hero in an awkward position trying to get her pack back on track and fighting the current leadership.  Cole and Sasha's chemistry is immediate and they soon realize what they mean to each other.  I loved Sasha's wicked humor and Cole is a wonderful alpha and a perfect match for Sasha.  Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
12,"Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over. Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game. Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth. The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so. those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games. will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
11,"Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players. Three or more is ideal. Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill. You may keep one route. or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to &#34;buy&#34; your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much. we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
11,"This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it. especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"
11,"I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it.  After two plays. she decided that. nope. it was not her thing;  she didn't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I'm not sure why -- buying & selling. etc. do not usually interest me but this game is great fun.  Elves. dwarves. gnomes. a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game.  It has one of the best rule books I've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
11,"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling 'Speed Scrabble' for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn. he yells 'Draw 2!' and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles. like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people. it does help to have two sets of tiles. of course."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."

7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"If they made more games like this. I'd be a pauper. Intelligent. funny. easy to use. easy to solve. and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking. gorgeous. well-written. and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed. so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble. though."
11,"Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles.  I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they don't line it up right and can't get the lid on. The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle 'At the Zoo' is a fun open interpretation.  It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place.  My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend 'At the Zoo' or any of Mudpuppy's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
11,"For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game.  My son is 7.  Fortunately. there are Basic and Advanced rules.  I found the Basic rules were sufficiently &#34;difficult&#34; and understandable.  We play with just three players. but it's easy to see how more players = more fun.  I happen to drive a manual transmission (and 6-speed to boot. just like the game) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself. with the only the sound of tumbling dice.

Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
12,"Ya know. I remember playing this game as a kid.I couldn't find this game anywhere. and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version. so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline. and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones. then you'd love this game.Pros (or cons):Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons (or pros):Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1. so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally. I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.Also. if anyone buys this game. then I have to tell you this: Please. if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>"
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
11,"What cute graphics on this puzzle! My animal loving girls (3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion. This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds!"
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
12,"This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game. not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much. it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
12,"posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great. u may think u should just rent it. but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio. and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line. great wepons. great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this."
11,"We bought 3 new games for family game nights :)  We saw episodes of Will Wheaton's youtube show. TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun (Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two).  Out of the three. this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use :)  Phrases. a song. a tune. a movie or book title...  It is a good test for one's knowledge. too (which is good for my kid hehe)...  We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge.  I hope they make expansions for it!"
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
11,"This isn't a game to sit down and play with your friends or family. It gets very chaotic and isn't much fun. But as an ice-breaker at a party while people are going about other things at the same time I expect it would be fun.The idea of the game is to try to get the most beads by finding people that fit a certain specification or getting people to do or say certain things. Everyone steals beads from everyone else and the player with the most beads at the end of the time (you can set the time for whatever you want) wins. The great thing about this game is if you wanted to you could easily buy more beads to play with.If you are looking for an ice-breaker game. I would recommend this. Otherwise you might be disappointed."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
12,"It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying 'duh'.  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!"
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
11,"Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough. that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything. but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing. so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
12,"this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
12,"first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun. second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU!!!!and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S. the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares .HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO.OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD"
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."

Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
12,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS. SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS. OR I should REALLY say is. &quot;Beanie Baby&quot;. and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY. this game should surplus 5 stars. I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1.000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly. I WANTED TO SEE PIT &quot;KID ICARUS&quot; IN THIS GAME. MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask. ask. ask! PRETTY SOON. THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND &quot;DAI-BIYESSO. DAI-BIYE!&quot; (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
10,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting. it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to 'try' to use. the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line. the way its supposed to be."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
12,"I'm what gamers call a 'Zelda Veteran' . I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging. different and fun to play.In this one. Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider. the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda. the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble. and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi. a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures. Link will learn spells. be swallowed by a huge fish. and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
10,"I bought this sander to replace a 3&#34; x 18&#34; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
11,"This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn.  Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays. which keeps it interesting. A great game for all ages. even if all of them don't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box.  The yellow is more chartreuse (yuck) and the orange is not very bright.  If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table. they're not visually very acute.  Our table has overhead lighting. so it's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile. as described."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
10,"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags. they are fine.  About 95% have no problem. but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight. they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these. but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers. but they don't. so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
10,"Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet.  This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss. and is lightweight and easy to use.  Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4' worm drive. so I grab the 5 1/2' skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size. and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way. it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet. go back to the kitchen."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
10,"I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit. but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle. you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what. this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
11,"This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old.  The Consensus from everyone was that it wouldn't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat.  The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do.  Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads.  This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
11,"There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason. This game is very fun and simple to teach new people. I've taught many of my family members how to play and they've all enjoyed it. I still need to purchase a few of the expansions. which would really open the game up a lot. but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby. you can't beat this starter set. The mechanics are super fun and streamlined. You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game. I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles. I highly recommend this game."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
10,"I have used one of these for five or six years now. It is very strong and very tuff; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great. I use two of them constantly. but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill. strong but not too heavy or bulky; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such. when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong."

1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
11,"Intended for 4 to 12 players. Party Gras encourages interaction with family. friends. and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party. celebration. etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill. thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.The idea is very good. but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think 'Did they just put that in the card?' And. that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.  If you want outrageous. ridiculous. but still fun action cards. I recommendQuelf Board Game.Overall. a game that had lots of potential. but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
10,"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good. I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also. this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
10,"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin. which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps.I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth. but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
10,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit.  It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!!  As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy. well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw.  It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so.  I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744.  If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
10,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice. neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising. it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience. but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
12,"The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color. The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games.  This time. Link doesn't have to save the world. but rather himself!  While Link is sailing on the ocean. his boat is struck by a lightning bolt. causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water. he lands on an island. But since he has landed on the island. all he can think of is getting off of it! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens.  This game has an excellent game play. and story-line! It is worth every penny!"
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
11,"I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures. so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However. for some reason. she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures. which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time. because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea. but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
11,"It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the 'rules' no one was really engaged in the 'play' aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an 'icebreaker'/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly. not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously. this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a 'party'."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
10,"If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and &#34;excellent&#34; joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt. you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer. eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put. these are the industry standard for a reason."
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
12,"With The Minish Cap coming out soon. and looking to be another disappointment (I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it. but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe). the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic. The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer. The graphics aren't very good; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes. but the game is so good one will hardly notice. The sound effects are pretty poor. but. thankfully. there's always the music to compensate for that...and what good music.It feels like ALttP. looks like it. plays like it. and is second only to that excellent SNES game."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
11,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also. the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
12,"When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid. I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck. I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story. an interesting environment. and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion. it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game. don't consider any longer. GET IT."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
10,"We have tried all types of blades. And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders! In 10' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight. we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 'Ultimate Crosscutting' blade! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours don't skimp on your crosscut blades! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud!And Fillet Your Wood!"
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
12,"For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated. this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play. although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too. in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and. in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or. indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission. or do the mission without support. as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs. and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
10,"I've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades.  I use them on my Ridgid 10' table saw. 10' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12' sliding miter saw. This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods.  I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades.  Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my 'best in class' award.  The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker.  To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website:  Life After 50--One Man's Perspective.  The link below will take you to my homepage where you'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL:  [...]"
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
10,"Overall a great sander. I have dropped.stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
12,"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all. the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store. buy it. You will have a good time with this game!"
12,"Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels.and don't forget our stars of the game.a brave.kicking butt little girl.Carrie.And a brave young whipping man.Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house.Dracula's castle.the forest.and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!"
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"&quot;Breath of Fire 3&quot; is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good. and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character. and then later in the game. you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre."
12,"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made. Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too). its rich. colorful and very addicting. The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!). and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous. I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement. its just really cool. this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player. Im serious if you dont have this. your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!"
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
12,"This game is super hard the first time around. Then. when you beat it. and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour. because almost all of it is puzzles. so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights. where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest. funnest fight is in the very beggining. when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units. and better levels. this game would be worth buying. but as it is it is not all that good."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."
6,"Avery Clean Edge Business Cards - #28878These business card blanks are designed specifically for use with an ink jet printer. Each sheet contains ten standard size 2' x 3.5' cards - eight sheets to a package (80 cards total). The sheets can be printed on both sides if required. The paper stock is a nice. heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel. Avery's Clean Edge feature allows the finished cards to literally 'snap' apart by bending the sheets backward. The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [...] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site. I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps. but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended."
12,"Ah. Spyro! Released in 1998 for the PS1. Spyro is the first entry of many. [Although. only the first three were any good. because the newer ones were owned by an poor company.]Graphics: 9/10: Horrible by today's standards. but very good by 1998 standards. Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10: Pretty catchy. nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound: 8/10: Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10: You control Spyro. the PO'd dragon. through many worlds. There he must collect gems. rescue dragons. fight enimies. bosses. and other dangers. and also use his trademark flame and charge moves. This game is a bit easy. but it's very entartaining.The game costs about 10$ about now. so buy it!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
12,"This game is great. You go through 5 different time portales. Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss. What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference. Oh! one more thing. press up. up. down. down. left. right. left. right. square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon.  This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation"
12,"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
11,"This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time.  In addition to placing your workers. when you place them. an amount of time has to pass.  Once enough time has passed. one of your oldest generation of workers dies.  They're removed from the game. and depending on what job they were doing at the time. they're either placed into the history book of the village or they're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village. by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village. by traveling. and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book. or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It's a fairly tight worker placement game. with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
12,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics. use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake."
12,"I have never managed to beat the game. can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours.  My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation.  She was getting frustrated with Crash. until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play.  Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first. you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want.  Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle).T.T.T.X.S(square).T.T.T.T.S.X.T.O.T.T.T.O.S.T.X.X.X.X. Maybe it is cheating. but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game. it makes playing it more fun!"
11,"Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other. The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused. It was sort of anticlimactic. It can take some time as you read each card (CAREFULLY) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds. And then suddenly the game is over. The second time we played things started to click and by the third game. we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it. Mind you. we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards. Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions. Reading carefully is crucial to this game. I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well."
12,"I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well. it was hard to locate where you were going. unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately. the writers expected us to know as well."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
11,"I'm not traditional. didn't grow up that way and have not lived that way...however. a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition.  So glad I did.  My daughter loves. Niko (that's what we named our elf) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night.  Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night.  We love it and so glad we purchased it.  When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email.  It's really very cute and creative.  The included book explains the story and tradition.  Great find. and I recommend!"
10,"I am a weekend woodwarrior.  Wanted a nice sliding miter saw.  Looked at all of them. fondled a few and them. then found this one on sale through Amazon.  This is a nice saw.  Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day.  Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square.  Adjustments were quick and easy. Very easy to use.  Manual is great. Dust collection is not that great. but it wasn't with my non-sliding miter either.  It's the nature of this type of machine.  What was my old miter saw?  A Bosch 12' that was stolen from my garage.  Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff.  Would buy this one again in a heart beat."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
11,"I'm a mother. trainer. and in-home childcare provider. so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success.  I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another 'homework' book to do.  I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they're presented; the price is great. too.  For $2. it's worth it.For all of my kids. I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool (or Kindergarten. 1st grade. etc.. depending on their age).  It's only $13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level.  I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare's Writing Center."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
12,"When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end. doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore. But with the recent purchase of a n64. i have again. found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful. fun cheats that it offers. This game changed the way we play games. totally. It is still one of the best games I own. right next to the newest xbox 360 games."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
10,"I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed. the action is smooth. and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw. I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita. I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks. no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to. but once you've used it awhile. you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
11,"I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed. another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
10,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708. the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction. particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece. but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides. removing for steep beveling. etc)."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
10,"If you own Unisaw. or any other large heavy machine for that matter. you really should consider getting a mobile base.  Delta's bases are strong. sturdy. look good and are very stable.  When I upgraded to a Unisaw. I also  bought the mobile base.  My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than  my contractors saw used to be.  With a quick step on the foot lever it  effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved  very easily.  A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the  saw and it rests solidly on 4 points. making it very stable.  This design  of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and  manouver.  If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was. put your  machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less  space and your shop will seem larger."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
12,"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game. Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said. I liked the characters. Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun: Single-Player: C+ Multi-player: B+Sound: B-Characters: B+Controls: A-Overall: B"
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced. yes. but you get Darth Vader as a pilot. and he is worth every point.  The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader. and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader (TIE Advanced) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
11,"This game is pretty fun for young children. in fact we did play it three times when we first opened it. However. it can be very hard to win the key is to get a high roll. If you ae unlucky like I was to roll low number you are out of luck a lot on this game. It is also hard to move all the way over to the other side of the board so that you can try the other 'mini games' there were a couple that seemed really fun but I never got to try them because my piece started way over on one side and they were on the other. I like the concept and who doesn't love Rudolph but I really think they could have made it a much more fun game."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
10,"Milwaukee. again. has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters. although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
11,"I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative 'deck-building' mechanic of that game.  I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone.  I usually don't buy games unless I've played them before so I know what to expect. but I decided to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did!  Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme.  The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent.  The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion. but it makes for a more involved experience.  I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard. Recommended!"
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
12,"Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example. you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself. although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in. like 40 Lines. on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top. Marathon. on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top. or Ultra. where you see how good you can do. except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
10,"My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result. puts his power tools through hell.  He's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s.  It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita.  I've never been sorry.  I'm not a pro. but I certainly enjoy having a powerful. accurate saw when I need to make home repairs.  I haven't found anything I can't slice through with this little monster.  I've had it several years and it works like a new tool.  The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard. thick lumber and has the added homeowner's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws.  There's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever."
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
12,"For all gamers out there. this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan"
12,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out. some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system. I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier. this is an early title for the N64. you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games. ignore it if your looking for the best."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
10,"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits. but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2' size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table. this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4' collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly. of course. and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers. in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers. you need one for backup in any case"
10,"Great sander. ample power. belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However. one time during use. I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up. wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing. and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired. but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord. and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that. the tool has performed flawlessly."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time. but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64. and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said. this is one of the most innovative. most fun. and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE. there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game. and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100"
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
12,"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot. the comedy. the political intrigues. an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was. whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again. you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew. think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell. this game's for you!"
10,"I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with 'drill'. Like . you look in the dictionary for 'Drill' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong. unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly. this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong. Be carefull."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
10,"When I put this blade on my old skil saw. I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me. If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all. try switching to this blade and see how it should be done! I've been cutting some 1/4&quot; oak finish beaded paneling and I don't even have to turn it face down. My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up. Not this blade. I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went. Not a mark to be seen. Great blade!"
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
10,"This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are."
11,"I am not big into playing games. but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand. I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic. You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. no complicated instructions. It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults (all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it). The games only take about 20 minutes so it isn't a big time commitment either. To me it's like a dominoes/Uno combo. but more fun and more variety of play. Very fun. excellent game. not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews."
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
12,"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system. the Playstation. Still. I have never grown tired of playing levels. which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack. the jungle is incredibly lush. and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder."
12,"What's amazing about how great this game is...well. it's that it does not rely on insane graphics. large amounts of memory. lightning-quick processing speeds. or mind-blowing sound.In fact. this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin. suck you in. and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2. etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one."
11,"Bananagrams is a brilliant game. It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble (the interminable length of some games or turns!) by making speed an issue. You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids (older for sure) to play as well. We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family. Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one. If you are at all interested in word games. you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round. So simple! Perfect. get it! Wish I had thought of it..."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
12,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use. even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse. U have to be in direct light to see the screen. and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point. biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use. though. and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time. and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool. and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly. in fact. that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible. and the port stays clear."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
12,"Like I've said before. Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996. the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays. every other game is a 3d adventure 'in the vain of Tomb Raider'.The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action. great graphics which still hold up today. and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending. and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?While TR 2 is the best in the series. this one will be the most remembered.Story: 6/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Fun: 8/10"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
11,"Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up. I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking. which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things. but accuracy is key. which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring. can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!"
10,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job. it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much. do more. and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
10,"This sander is very high quaility. and will last for years. It is very powerful. you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander. because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great. it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable. ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust. just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
12,"Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet. but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man. Dig-Dug. Galaxian. Phozon. and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun. but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall. I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
10,"I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem. I had very poor results.  Using solid wood. however. resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
10,"You'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago. I use this saw every day. I cut and/or cut and cope large base. large case. and large crown even 16&quot; bullnose shelving on custom homes. I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut. still dead on. I even straight cut cope joints. and the blade follows the bevel perfectly. In some houses the preference is Oak. and the cuts are knifejoint. Everyone I work with has one. swears by them. Just as good as the day I got it. It is not stationary either. it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer. I couldn't begin to count. even in a day. how many times the base has swiveled. rails have slid. bevel has been changed. and the saw has started.and it's just as accurate as the day I got it. I make my living with this saw. I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
11,"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy. sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different. fun scenery. which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book. and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers. and that's a couple years down the road."
10,"I own a home remodeling business. and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as 'chop' saws for rough framing duties; however. when I need to do finish work or flooring. I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid. durable and very accurate. and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure. 10'. 12' and 15' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings. but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility. portability. and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"
11,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around. add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality. stickers can be pulled off. moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift. party favor and holiday present."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
11,"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you &#34;get it&#34; you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games. but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know. game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper &#34;in your head&#34; like I did. then you will LOVE this!"
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
12,"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure. thriller. problem solving. and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours. but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game."
12,"This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good. and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before. and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me. you will get your money's worth! Good graphics. excellent sound scores. huge worlds. and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority. even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through. and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
11,"This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme.  This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination.  For avid fans of the Simpsons. the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character (even the obscure ones) to get the answer right.  The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together.  If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans. you won't be disappointed buying this."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
12,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game. i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube. so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
10,"I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact. it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
12,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics.better realism. and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good. after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
12,"When the day I got unreal and tried it. I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was. the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game. you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):VortexRikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali. then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj. you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel. you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real. no it's not. it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating. breath taking missions. where you fight for life to survive. collecting itemslike defenses and weapons. travel through temples. facilitys. castles. bases. mountians. journey through what napali has to offer. and end up and the skaarj mothers ship. confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone!I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!"
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration. thinking. and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair. fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board. the style of the cards. and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
8,"My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not. it appears that people have warped theirs. started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)"
6,"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows. this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program. and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;). which is what this calculator uses. to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move. so I am purchasing another.  RJB."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
11,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth. the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well. he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player. I still want to join the group. but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes. 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
4,"I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed. although it looks mildly different. you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times. but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!"
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
6,"Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them.  Besides the obvious return labels. I've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement. birthday party gift bags. folders.  They stick well. print well. and are templates for various printing softwares (I've been a PrintShop user for a very long time. occasionally use Microsoft Word. and use Avery DesignPro5).  DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat. direction. hot or cold. where to. so I did some up in PrintShop.  They haven't fallen off. they haven't faded.  We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling. and Avery did that job as well.  Many uses for me. besides the obvious."
9,"I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually."
10,"Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered. i'm going for number 6.  I should give up. up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt. direct from Delta. was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places. almost beyond recognition.Needless to say. I'm VERY disappointed."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
6,"These are white shipping labels...but THESE are good quality ones that don't peel off.  They are 2 inches x 4 inches. and come 10 labels per sheet.  They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template. or you can simply peel. stick. and and write on one...no bleeding if you use a permanent marker. either.  Even if I don't always use these for shipping. they are great stick on labels for most anything.  I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose.  And they are thick enough that you can't read anything underneath them...a big plus no matter what you use them for."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"This is sharp. cuts and trims very well. and seems sturdy enough for my uses. which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt.  However I sometimes need to do precise trimming. as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product.  And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback.  The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch.  There is no easy sight reference. either--a red line. a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments.  This is a pain and unnecessary.  The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it.  I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary.  Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
5,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First. it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be 'gentle' with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second. the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable. heavy duty. and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!"
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
4,"This film is a must see. To little is known about the true ruthlessness of the Soviet era. As pointed out in the film it did not stop when Stalin died. American schools do not teach this and a recent column by Barry Rubin pointing out just how this has been glossed over and ignored by virtually everybody. Not only should you watch it but it should be shared with all who will sit for it.One critique I might have is when they go into Trotsky's murder they should tell you that he set up Lennin's secret policde and did mor than a little murder himself. He was no marter."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
11,"My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games. Scrabble in particular. my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously. we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players. a single round can take quite awhile."
5,"To be clear: I am quite the newbie guitar player.After i managed to break a string on my electric guitar. i decided to try and tackle replacing the strings myself. as most guitarists do. Things went alright. but on trying to tune the thinnest string. it broke. I just figured it was something I did. and wasn't the products fault. so i grabbed another string from another pack and that one went on fine. Overall. i've played quite abit with these strings. and have yet to break another one. Pretty good sound quality. and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion."
11,"This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these. they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult. you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy."
8,"I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo. so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note.  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up."
5,"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less 'clicky' - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same. I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point. so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop. they sound and feel just right to me. and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
10,"This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package. I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well. adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly. now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
9,"I have had a coleman lantern for years. back before they were dual fuel even.  I always burned dual fuel  or mogas as the army called it best add ons were a hard case. an amber  glass globe . and a spark starter so i didn't have to look for matches.  if you're careful you can get several uses out of the mantles but I always kept a few spares on hand in the bottom of the hard case.  These lanterns last forever with a little maintenance  mine was bought for me by my ex wife when we were first married I just wish our relationship had lasted as long as the lantern"
4,"This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world. the creator. Yet. there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling."
10,"I have owned this drill for about a year.  There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this 'old school' power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful. smooth. not heavy. balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too 'old school'...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious. Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar. that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!"
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
10,"Light. almost too light; and relatively quiet.  Not as agressive as I would like. even with 60 grit.  Dust collection bag still obtrusive and tends to spew extra fine dust into ones face if the unit is held at a ninety degree angle.  The angular design makes for a secure fit upside down in a bench vise so one can hand feed smaller pieces for shaping.  I rarely use a belt sanders and then only to hog off amounts to then use the RO sander.Bottom line:  I love Bosh anything so if I had the money I would have spent extra to get a heavier duty machine by Bosch."
6,"hello.out of paper and need some the next day?  you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services.  the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast. that we were surprised to see the package on our porch.  the product is the standard hp paper. but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished.  96 is perfect for everyday printing. for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality.  this is a great product."
1,"She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes. so I bought her one of these. When I saw it. I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
6,"Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot). they are superior in terms of fit. function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels. let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon. as compared to any in-person stationary type store."
8,"I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them 'scream'.  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore. then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him. because I thought that he would love the 'Oh NO!' sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the 'Oh NO!' sounds from all over the house.  Sadly. Mr. Bill has been retired. because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in. I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway. great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!"
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I loved history in grade school. junior high into high school though my junior year a teacher ruined it for me with her non-teaching ways with popping in a video and leaving a worksheet before leaving the room for the period. Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS. bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education. Now that I am enrolled in University my love for learning and history is coming back. American Heritage Series has brought my love of history back! Love that He encourages you to read the original documents and research for yourself. Thank you Mr. Barton and God bless you."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
10,"Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272. This gun is fast and reliable! The 'dial-up' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters. The gun is light; powerful; well balanced; and rugged. For the average homeowner's drywall needs. this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun (which can be very pricey). because I hate dragging around a cord. But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun. get it. you won't be sorry."
4,"Less a mystery. more a study of human nature (everyone has a hidden agenda).  In this case. the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts.  A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh (Corin Redgrave) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing (he presumes dead) years ago.  He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion. becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise.  Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin. who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior.  I found it fascinating; it certainly kept my attention throughout.  I was. however. disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
5,"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull. and I absolutely love their sound. feel. and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes. these strings have a great. uplifting sound to them. hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them. nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel. clean and smooth. When replacing. I ran into no problems. quick and easy. I love the strings and their price. definitely will stick with this brand as well."
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
11,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2. they have moved on. so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality. made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times. then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
10,"This is my pick for the best RO sander. It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand. The dust collection is great. The little  canister is easy to dump and you're back at it in no time. Variable speed  is a must for fine work. You don't always want full power. like when you  just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture. You can dial  it down real low if you want to. This coupled to the pad control feature  means no ruined work. ever. I use this sander far more than my Dewalt.  Bosch and Makita RO sanders"
9,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys. as well as for a gift for a girls' 3rd b-day. I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party. playgroup. or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking. cooperation. and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!"
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
1,"I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then. when trying to get the lather to come out slowly. you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable. but doesn't really burn. The lather. itself. comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not. I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
4,"It took a month for me to actually receive this film. I have been waiting for years to see this. the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection. I should have waited longer. Even if you don't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print. or that the title is spelled wrong. or that the cover and label are ugly as sin... you should not buy it. Why? Because the last chapter of the disc doesn't play! You can't even watch the whole film all the way through. I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same. I'm going to avoid all DVDs from &quot;Cine Vu&quot; from now on."
9,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see. the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water. a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one). and it worked great.  You're on the right track. but keep looking...stay with propane. but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern. so it is a quality control/product issue.  C'mon Coleman...build it US. build it right."
9,"I have this mounted onto a S&W; M&P; 15/22 rifle with Millett steel rings and a UTG high riser.I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea. which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it. but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.FWIW. I like more magnification than this. but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer. but that's because I like more light and more magnification."
9,"I liked this better than a keyed lock because you can literally grab it and run! No need to try and look for a tiny key. In an emergency you want to be able to get to it fast and this way anyone can unlock it- only if they have the combination.I bought a 6pack and my buddy and I split them. Now we both have our guns locked and safe.I let me brother use my gun a little while ago- he called and asked what the code was and I told him... THAT EASY! good thing there was a code and not a key because I had forgot to tell him initially. Would have sucked to go out to the range and not have a key!No lost key or anything- this is a great purchase and I would recommend it over a cable or keyed trigger lock any day!"
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
8,"Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight. all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose. nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And. uh. this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share. but I think it's time to call the vet."
10,"This is a well-made product. and if you typically use the same size (and kerf) blades in your table saw most of the time. it's probably worth picking one of these up.  I've been using mine for about three years. and have been pleased with its durability and stability.  I have made a bunch of shop-made inserts myself (1/2 inch Baltic birch with self-tapping machine screws to adjust the height).  I used the original insert from the saw as a template. rough cut the plywood a band saw. and used double-stick tape to attach the original and the wood insert together.  A flush trim bit on the router makes quick work of finishing."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"They are not made in the USA anymore. but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then."
11,"This game has great strategy. a great theme and is easy to learn.  There are however two big drawbacks.1. It is very extreme. the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin.  They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either. you're pretty much done for.2. Because of the aforementioned drawback. there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning.  This is ok if you're an experienced gamer but it'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it's their first time so be careful."
8,"I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type. but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews. but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
5,"nice sturdy construction for the most part. although I don't like the plastic that connects the fabric to the ends. But for the price. you get what you pay for. I would have much better liked it if they were metal. I put this on my Les Paul and it fit good. but I decided it was not the look I wanted on that guitar so I put it on my BC Rich instead. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar. so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position. the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. I'll give it a try for a while. but I think that is going to annoy me and will need to find it a new home on one of my other guitars or just keep it around as a spare."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
9,"These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob. when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to. they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol. but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean. smooth and fresh shave. get this and change timely."
7,"I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy. are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years. and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly. they lock very smoothly. much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease. despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
11,"What can I say that other parents and grandparents haven't already said in their reviews? This is a fantastic book...Since it is fall/early winter now. my daughter's tooties are covered up so we use our hands. She loves this book. She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages. Yes. it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books (Goodnight Moon-type) and shorter books like this one...so for us the length is perfect!We've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months. Very sturdy. high quality. I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas. I'm also buying Little Hands Love. I'd picked up 'Feet' on an Xmas shopping whim. I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today!"
9,"These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin. it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad. like real bases."
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
11,"this is a great filler. You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home. There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts. have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn. or meet specific timeline requirements. The third option is the core of the game. There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table. Each card represents a year. Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand. These are called Linchpin cards. Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history. What happens if Lincoln isn't assassinated? Or the Challenger never blew up? Each change in history has a ripple effect. Events in future years can be changes. creating paradoxes in time. These paradoxes can be &#34;patched&#34; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction. fun mechanics. and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play. this is a great choice."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
8,"I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog. however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now."
9,"About ten years ago friends got me one of these for a birthday present and since then I have become dependent on one. I am a millwright by trade and a tinkerer by heart. This is the handiest tool to keep in ones pocket. Forget Leathermen or the like. This tool takes very little space for what it can do.The cutting blades hold and edge as good as any knife.better than Buck. I lost my original last week :(. I cut some rope at a lumberyard to bind a load in my truck and must have left it on the bumper. When I could not find it I immediately came here and ordered another.This thing is hard to beat."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
11,"Recently. I purchased a couple of sets of magnetic poetry for family.  The Little Box of Sin was one of them.  Through my purchase. I have learned that magnetic poetry sets that are under 100 magnets are pretty useless.  If you don't have other magnetic poetry pieces at home. the sentences you will be able to make will be boring.  Seventy-two magnetic pieces is not enough - there is not a vast selection of words.  The set had words like wine. pleasure. greed. lust. love. wicked and  excess and supplemental words like out. us. all. to. and is.  The set lacked lacked words like bed. chocolate. him. her.  I found the  magnets to be hard to break apart.  The tin is nice. but it is small.  If I had seen this set prior to purchase. it would have never made it into my shopping cart.Made in the United States."
11,"This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall. it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old. though. Luckily. most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
10,"This drill has great torque. it will twist your hand off if you use the the old 'hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit' method.  I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident.  Using this drill you better not do it!This drill will handle anything you throw at it. but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed!"
9,"I have to laugh at this one. The cheesy picture behind the hole. the fake &#34;traps&#34;. the generally terrible build quality...it's so lame it is in fact kind of funny. But for 40 bucks the joke's on you if you buy it.At least it does return the ball. For that it gets an extra star.I'd give this four stars at 15. and five at 10. But all of these astroturf-y putting matts are basically the same. so look on craigslist and find one for five bucks. there's always lots around. Or buy one here for far less than this. Or just use a glass on its side on the rug. But OMG. then you have to take a couple steps and get the ball yourself!One tip: put tiny little tea bags etc under the matt at various places for a more realistic roll. makes it more fun too."
5,"This Dunlop 'Ergo Pickholder' is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy. especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick. you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
10,"Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking. It has yet to fail me. The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room.  I have moved more into working (small furniture) and still love it.  Just recently the electric brake was intermittent. and I went back to the manual. Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum. and it's fine again. I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts. It's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length. It's a trial and error process. and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment."
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
10,"Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router.  Fits up to the plunge base only.  Will not fit up to the fixed base.  The fixed base has its own model edge guide.  However. this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide. In addition. it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after (3) months of use.Holds its setting very well. no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However. chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
4,"I really like this video! No. it doesn't work you really hard. but it's an excellent alternative for days when you have less energy. I use it when I am not going for the most intense workout I can get. but still want to get my heart rate up and sweat( it's about 40 minutes). What I enjoy about it is that it's really fun to do. Everybody looks like they're having a good time. The music by the live band is great and the moves are a lot of fun. I'm sure that this one will remain a favorite of mine for a long time."
2,"I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later. and with CONSTANT. REGULAR. FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen. the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most. thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle. not the black/white one shown in the photo. so don't be shocked if you get something different!"
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
11,"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said. this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like 'meaningless' conversations or activities. then this will not be for you. For a large party. this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun. relax. enjoy it.  It's only a game."
4,"This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron. left orphaned when thieves invade his home. lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends. the drum his parents gave him. and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates. Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too). Paul Frees as all three Wise Men. and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song. one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty. Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch. this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
11,"This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train. and someone else takes it. which ruins your entire game plan.Overall. it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play. so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
5,"I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams. but alas. I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully. but the cutter doesn't allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference. so I'm back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all. a good product to have if you don't have pliers on hand or don't mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesn't have pegs - luckily. the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge. which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own. I suppose."
8,"My 6 month old. 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one. HOWEVER. the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp. flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big. pink. patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted. sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew. but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers. hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN. NYLABONE. =("
9,"Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down. then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade. and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
1,"purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier. this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu. for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page."
8,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However. after a few weeks on this product. she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!). I'm switching to something more palatable."
11,"This is a great way to play hangman. No wasting of paper and it's so solid it can be used anywhere. My six year old grandson likes to play this in church. The only drawback is the snapping sound of the 'tiles' as they are turned over. I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the 'tiles'. That doesn't work on the printed side. but I'm going to try some clear rubber 'dots' for those sides. Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise. but the younger ones have a harder time if they aren't very patient. If noise isn't a factor. then you'll like this a lot."
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
1,"Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A. and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness. and believe me. this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However. some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy. therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining."
8,"I normally buy the Large. super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However. it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy. and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw. then this bone is for you."
7,"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one. there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the 'high power' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry. this little guy gets in between the bush's. shrubs. plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard. saving a few hours of raking."
5,"I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George. I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set."
1,"Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each. this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target. Walmart. etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh. lemony. sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each. which helps to increase the value and lower the cost."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
8,"I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month. after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up. I bought Bayer Advantage it works great. for a whole month. killing all fleas. I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline."
5,"I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle."
1,"I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore. and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit. and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment). and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these. but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer."
4,"Being a long time Star Wars fan. this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars. but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
4,"I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge. three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla.rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!"
4,"i may be a metalhead. but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome. but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible. like satan carrying around a baby. Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids.and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior. remember these three things: Jesus died. Jesus rose. and Jesus is coming again."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
8,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage. privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight. which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall. I have owned several of these.  Eventually. they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it."
8,"I have two dogs. one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all. it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart. stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now. it's in their toy basket that they always have access to. they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this."
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
9,"I swim at the local gym 1-2 times a week. Found this pair of googles with great reviews and a decent price so I pulled the trigger. I have been wearing these goggles for over 6-months now and am very happy with them. The goggles are comfortable around the eyes and the strap stays on in a secure and comfy fashion. I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints. If you are looking for a comfy pair of goggles to use for recreational swimming that come with a decent price tag then you should look no further!"
11,"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted. but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly."
8,"My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors. but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food. my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great. but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming. but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products. so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)"
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
4,"There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love. humanity. and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations. essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity."
10,"I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed. 50% or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand. I use my tools hard. but with care and maintenance. and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit. This 3107 DVS is new but I don't expect it to be any different. I don't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac. Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old. So much said! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money."
1,"My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!"
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
5,"I have played on D'addario Before.  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok.  but can wear out real fast.  So. It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks. pinched hormonic's vibrato's. extreme bend's.  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings.I did try extra light (while they do soud nice.and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's.  cause beginer's tend to press hard. when they first stat out.Personally.  I don't like D'addario's at all.  I find the tone to bright."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
5,"While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals. I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for. a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit."
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
1,"Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However. I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling. even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass. but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes."
7,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however. there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first. it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
5,"These picks far exceed my expectations. I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest. nicest looking picks I own.  They look great. feel great and play great.  Call me a snob. but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself. buy these.I love the color and texture too. they don't slip or move around as you play."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
8,"PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- 'dry. ground. rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass.'2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine. so it shouldn't be the only protein source. which it isn't. (Yes. your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product. leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains. leftover meats. and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'."
8,"So. Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys. but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over. because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days. but the squeaker has survived. and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty. we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker. and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money. for sheer entertainment value."
5,"I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken. but I didn't want any down time. so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time. and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine. I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar. it falls almost immediately out of place again. So. I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed. unlike this brand new bad cable."
4,"Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster or Godzilla # 5 as some may file it is a good entry in the long running series. I've never been a huge fan of Ghidorah in part because it seems to be more puppet than man in a suit monster so he has a lot less emotion than most of the other giant monsters from Japan. This is probably intentional as he is a mindless giant creature of destruction.This one is a bit talky for me. but we do get the first real monster team up here with Godzilla. Rodan and Mothra doing battle with the title monster. Lots of fun in this one once it gets rolling and this DVD edition from Classic Media does include both U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. This and many other Godzilla/ToHo titles are at bargain prices. so if you're wanting to add them to your collection. these are very nice editions."
9,"I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway. if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for. and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it."
1,"Although the part numbers have changed over the years. this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge. and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)"
8,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor. you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down. which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals. so maybe if you have only one or two. it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all. not a bad product. but could use a little improvement."
4,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.  However. any other film maker probably would have made this movie so unbelievable that viewers wouldn't know how vicious Christ's death was.  Mel Gibson lets us see exactly what it was like 2000 years ago in Israel.  No sugar coating or anything artificial.  Gibson doesn't hold back and leaves no stone unturned.  Gibson captures the essence of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for us all.  Not to be  preachy. but I hope those of you who watch this movie know about the life Jesus lived and appreciate his sacrifice for our sins.  This movie hits home and is clearly the best film of 2004."
10,"I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway. and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin. it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!"
10,"I. Love. My. Fein tool.  It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done. in renovating a 100+ year old home.  Some have found the blades don't last well but they have for me.  I'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but. considering how much time and aggravation they've saved. it is well worth it.  I don't do that kind of cutting  with this flush cut blade. of course. but it is one of those tools that. when you need it. you need it and there's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile. that's for sure."
7,"This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard. but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to. but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner. you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall. we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
10,"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters. missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate. it has to be the best 10' CSMS on the market! Get one new. get one used -- but get one!"
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
1,"The clean and renew system works very well. at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time. and to improve the 'feel' of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month. and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a 'heavy' cleaning.  The system obviously has a 'cost' associated with the refills. but overall. it seems to be worthwhile."
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
5,"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar. as I often find myself playing with fingers. then suddenly a 'pick song' starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it. and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick. but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it. but the 'spreading strings' on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So. still highly recommended if your headstock has a 'straight through' design. not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )"
4,"I personally find Big Bird to be an annoying character. but this show is pretty good for helping to teach the alphabet.  I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher.  I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos. Bear in the Big Blue House videos. and even Elmo videos.  I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either. because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.)  We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore.  Maybe she's too old (28 months). but I doubt it.  She still loves to watch Sesame St. on PBS."
1,"I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far. I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip. I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham"
3,"There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix. he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night. they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!"
8,"My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs. so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence. and if I scale it back a titch too much. it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence."
8,"I have used this for years without a problem. but I believe that they have changed the formula. because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints. and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great. and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes. but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs. so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
10,"I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up. Mirka was recommended. so I decided to give it a try. especially since a 50-pack costs $17. vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks. there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper. I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks."
5,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber. but other than that. the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
3,"Even for an essay. this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic. and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions. this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
3,"This whole 'instantly recognizing your mate' thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth 'shifting' when emotions run high. very cool!! If you like the genre. you'll like this: family. loyalty. friends. and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action. and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not. if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
3,"This one was my least favorite. I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too. trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong."
10,"Overall this is a nice product. but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately. I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton. and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64' thickness of the lamination. I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination."
9,"As soon as I learned that TSA has announce plans to allow small knives starting April 25. I rushed to my computer and bought a new one.The knife is a great basic tool - small scissors. tweezers. a small knife. and a nail file/flat screwdriver.  I wish that it had an LED light. and some mini pliers would be nice. but this is pretty good for a key ring.More detail on the TSA: according to what I've read. the TSA is planning to allow knives under 6 centimeters in length and 1.27 centimeters in width. starting April 25. 2013.  I suppose plans could change. but from what I can tell. this should qualify.Update: After some more research. I probably prefer theVictorinox Midnite Manager. which adds a Philips screwdriver. a bottle opener. and a pen. but loses the tweezers and toothpick.  This is still a great tool. though. and less pricey. so poke around and see what you like."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
12,"X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade."
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
5,"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy. except distilled water.  In all actuality. its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry. you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets 'hydrated?'. I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills. so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall. good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J"
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
4,"When this first aired in 1979. I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS. I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD. this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago. and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
8,"Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless. no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
4,"It is amazing how much like todays current events are leading in the same direction as this Soviet Story. It is also the story of the book of Judges. How easy it is for new generations to fall into the same errors as our fathers did. The impact on every generation and every nation is more than evident. Yet! Some how my generation didn't fully understand what took place in WWII our else they failed to instill in the succeeding generations the importance of submitting ourselves to the obedience of grace .To God's credit he hasn't destroyed us yet .He keeps reworking the clay into a image that seams good for him to make .what it should look like is in the mind of the potter. It is truly amazing how God uses every thing in our life to perfect in us all the qualities of the Christ ."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
12,"I was a vivid gamer back in the day. and Mario was always one of my all time favorites. I have long since moved away from the video game scene. but now and then I play the classics on the PC. And when I played this version. I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA. The graphics are the same. the gameplay is the same. the sound is the same. but there is new extras and bonus stuff. a pathway to choose. multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. (1) game ever! Even better then Mario All Stars (snes) version!!!"
3,"This is a sequel to Two Sighted. I suggest you read that first to get full understanding of the story. Christina. TJ and Jon were featured in Two Sighted and this story picks up shortly afterward.Christina has been fighting her attraction to TJ and Jon for a long time. she doesnt' trust men and from their physical size. she's sure the can't trust them. In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues. She's heard rumors but they couldn't possibley be true. could they?TJ and Jon have been waiting for Christina to show some interest and finally they feel she's ready. They have been ready and now is the time! But Christina's family is once again coming between her and her future.I love Ann Jacobs sensual romances because they tell a story. you don't just get continous sex."
4,"Oscar Wilde once wrote. 'Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new. complex. and vital.' 'The Passion of the Christ' is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not. but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view. the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired. the cinematography is brilliant. and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism. moments of heartrending beauty. and of course. disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch. but. rather. quite painful. but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing."
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
3,"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations. then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story. it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good. but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella. but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first. book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall. I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series. because I love books dealing with military men :)"
12,"To be perfectly frank. the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase. the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So. if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price. get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market."
3,"Four years ago Garrett Winslow and Haley Turner had a hot and heavy affair in Mexico. A tragedy took him away and he never looked back. Unfortunately. when Haley went looking for the man she fell for in Mexico she couldn't find him because he gave her a false name. Garrett has always been wary of false affections because of his wealth but he has never felt that wonderful true feeling he shared with Haley in Mexico. Now they meet again and he discovers that he left her with more than just a good time. Can he win her heart once again?The Billionaire's Baby is a short and sweet romance that is plump with emotion. Leanne Banks packs this novella with tons of heat and heart! I love Haley's stubborn nature and Garrett's relentlessness. They make a gorgeous couple and the plot is swift and endearing.Reviewed by MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"This thing is great! If I remember. I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy. and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be. which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now. and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue. it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder."
9,"very loud very high pitch. pealess design. came with extra split ring. dont forget to get a lanyard as one is not incuded with this whistle. ordered mine in brite yellow for boating.update July5.2012: something interesting I wasnt aware. on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code. [one blast: 'where are you?'. two blasts: 'come to me.'. three blasts: 'I need help!'. if you hear any of these signals. respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box. may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing. if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code. I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
5,"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn. nicked. picks. Rapidly.firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick. repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice."
2,"I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website. That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available. I was delighted to find OXO made one. OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle. With my other peeler. my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes. I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler. The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control. The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp. I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools."
9,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down. he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger. he was able to ride more successfully. but I would say still not comfortably. Also. getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike. IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
3,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars. catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually. I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable. better written. and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still. the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more. but if you like this period of history. you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens. retired editor"
9,"I have owned several Swiss Army knives including the Hunter. Champion. Climber and this small Tinker. I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more 'tools'. I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade. bottle opener. philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase. Personally I like this Swiss Army knife the best."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
5,"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar. only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs. which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing. it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson. but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!"
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
5,"I love this system.  Every time I change strings now. I go through every step of this system. and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good. and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size. and washable."
7,"This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves. branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days. I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap. the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended."
12,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did. all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap. kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19."
8,"That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers. they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again."
9,"In my opinion. this is the best multi-tool that can be had.I did a lot of shopping around for a larger multi-tool.If you just get out there and simply handle them. you willfeel the superiority of quality in this tool.Every tool is solid and useful. every tool has a nice crispsnap.  Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable. as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said. you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.  I like buying American products too....but when it comesdown to it. I'm going with quality."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
12,"Thinking back on the times of Zelda. have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking. I remember how fun and exciting it was. and it was so good. because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game. please get it. it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years. you too can think of what a great game Zelda was. but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2. but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also."
8,"I got this in the mail today. sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month. so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later. but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today. she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far"
12,"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is. but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d. others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay. but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago. but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that. it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it. don't expect it to live up to all the hype."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
2,"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list. and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was 'awesome.' I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise. but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet. but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."
12,"The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading. but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur. Starmie. Vulpix. Vileplume. Articuno. Electabuzz. Ponyta. Gloom. Tangela. Lickitung. Mewtwo. Chansey. Taurus. Jynx. Oddish. Golbat. Horsea. Dragonite and Magmar.Game play : A-Sound : B-Originality : A-Story: C-Trading : A-Fun : AReplay : A++Overall : B4 stars."
4,"I don't see Christ but brutal violence. This seems a documentary film to me. Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus. I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways. finally died. Yes. you will see how Jesus suffered and died. vividly to your eyes. Period. The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however. quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle. Do not expect any delete scenes. extra features. casting. or director's commentary. Nothing. Period.Be honest. say if the man in the film is not Jesus. would you rate it the same? If not. because he's not Jesus? Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen. 1-Oct-2004)"
12,"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old. and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities. and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time. obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative. or well designed. but it is classic.  In the end. and as a fan of the Alien series. I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series."
3,"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes. I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short. but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella."
2,"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make 'frozen ANYTHING' with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it."
5,"I picked up one of these at Guitar Center a while back.  At first. it seemed unstable. but then I tried to open it up a little more. and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here.  When it's opened up all the way. it is relatively stable. and is suitable for servicing your own guitar.  As others say. it does fold up nicely. and takes up minimal space in my toolbox.  I wouldn't use this if I made a living servicing guitars. as I don't think it would last long due to the quality of materials (it does feel pretty cheap.)  But it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while.I imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt.  Over all. I'm happy with the purchase. as it suits my needs."
12,"A very fun game that has to do with teamwork! I don't understand why they didn't make it co op. but it's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes. It's also one of my favorite Sonic character's debut! E-123 Omega! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game. I don't know why they had to kick him out when he's a member of the Chaotix. And shouldn't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix. too? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles. and. although the graphics aren't PS3 amazing. they're good for a PS2 game. The game's good for a Sonic fan at any age. you don't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game (although I'm both ^_^)."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
2,"I find it hard to imagine how I've done without a potato ricer all my life!  The Oxo potato ricer is a great size for one to two people (though it would also work well for a larger crowd on special occasions. it would just take a little longer) and is well constructed. I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two. I didn't mind not having the interchangeable disks. the size of the holes on this ricer were just the perfect size to make nice. fluffy Yukon Gold potatoes. I even threw two cloves of garlic into the pot with the potatoes. then riced them along with the potatoes for a very tasty bowl of garlic potatoes. I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!"
7,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window. under an awning on the northeast side of the house. not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact. I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately. nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
2,"I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.  I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.  I decided to try this pair because of the name - OXO - I have loved every one of the products I have purchased from them - and the price.  Well. I was so impressed. I had to buy a set for myself as well.  These are the knives I reach for everyday.  My expensive set of knives are on my counter. but the convenience. comfortable feel and the good job that the OXO knives do - they are the ones I use most often.  At this price. I can't imagine any home without them!"
10,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine.  But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars.  Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard.  All in all. a disappointemnt.  I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign.  Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
5,"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise. it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass."
3,"Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year.  He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs.  Tonight is no different. except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett. more so than any other man in a very long time.  When she sees Leo at the club. she can't help but bring him upstairs.  Lisa has a plan. She knows Brett's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure. Delightfully erotic. I found Brett's attraction to Leo just downright arousing.  Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams.  M&eacute;nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me. Full of sensuality. it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
9,"The product is exactly as described. The combination of the two grits. groove for tip sharpening. color coding. plastic/rubber construction. locking sheath. etc make this a very convenient. portable and durable sharpening tool. Its not going to get you razor sharp but it will keep your field tools sharp enough. do it quickly and take a butter knife to good enough skinning quality in no time. Its also light weight and requires little to no maintenance. The only 'problems' I have with it is the width and no easy way to lay it level and supported. Both issues are easy to remedy but perhaps aspects for the manufacturer to look at for improvement."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
7,"But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost. with an approximate ratio of 1:2. and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate. or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around. as they would be most places. this product isn't strictly necessary. but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though. it's likely to help out."
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
8,"ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time. so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD. the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same . and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs. so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
4,"This is by far the best video I have ever done. especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha. Merengue. Salsa. Samba. and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!"
7,"The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it. and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side. like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought. manufacturer....."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
12,"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now. but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it 'E'. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game. but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked. but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date."
12,"The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior. finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games. such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64. I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of .... a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
2,"I love everything about this vacuum. The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery. I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries. Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use. I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise. but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs. I have a shop vac. so if anything major were to happen. it's there. You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway. Between the two vacs. it's perfect.It's so lightweight. carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing. but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks. you might want to pick up a couple of these."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."
12,"yes this game has VERY good game play it has 18 levels to unlock and 2 secret levels and very good you will wanna play this game over and over be cuz of all the secrets u can find if use a game shark u can get all of the old beta stuff and this game is a MUST HAVE the world is not enough 64 was good but its game play died it only has 14 levels and twine was not very good maybe voice was in it but IT IS NOT BETTER THEN GOLDENEYE 007 U MUST BUY THIS GAME ITS A JAMES BOND CLASSIC THIS GAME IS ALWAYS TO GET IT AND PUT IT IN YOUR 64 AND TURN UP THE HEAT but twines mutl player make u get sick of the game goldeneye may have bad mutl player but its better twine has arond 123 guys to pick from for mutl"
10,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box. the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself. get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal. and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
3,"Love. love. love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story 'ever after' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
10,"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth. it is powerful. it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean. buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!"
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
6,"I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly. or that dispenses erratically. you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands. so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly. nearly invisible. and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves."
8,"My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls. so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls. but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it. I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me. not the Launcher.  My dog did. ultimately. like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day. when I wasn't looking. he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting. it wasn't such a bad deal."
12,"No doubt. the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system. and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels. and is very challenging. but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get. but once you do. it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall. you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
10,"This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions. or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff. get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)"
4,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean. what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie. look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses. Abraham. David. Jacob. and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
4,"We have purchased many copies of this to give away. and of course. have one for ourselves.  We first got our copy on video years ago and my husband watched it over and over while he was recovering from surgery.  The movie is a dramatized. word for word narration of the book of Matthew. using the NIV translation.  The acting overall is good. the scenery and costumes accurate.  I have to say. I was a little taken back by the voice of Jesus. played by Bruce Marchiano. and that bothered me at first. but I got used to it. and really enjoyed the movie.  Well done and highly recommended."
4,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better. more authentic. and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials. which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway. everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a &#34;prequel&#34; of sorts. telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle. the dungeon. and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
8,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end. none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
10,"It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the 'Best in Class'.  Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6.  What sold me was the metal gears. nice feel. good trigger. obvious to the point of 'art' quality. and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art. it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
3,"Dragon Knights. Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone. but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's. Maiden Flight. mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book. I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date. Keeper of the Flame."
12,"I havn't played Myst yet. but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics. great sound. great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world. but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all. WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy. puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
8,"I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However. I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out. and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday. and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now. so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula. since a lot of people mention it."
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
10,"I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw. I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?"
3,"The negative reviews were leaning me towards not reading this book. After reading it it's not that bad it's just another case of different strokes for different folks. Rebecca travels through time to 1715 to James who is a pirate. while the other Rebecca originally from 1715 travel to the present. There was a little action as well as good loving between Rebecca and James. the original Rebecca from 1715 was a meanie to everyone around her so when the Rebecca who came from the present was around everyone they saw this change of a nice Rebecca so that lead James to wonder about the new Rebecca. Hope I'm not confusing. But it wasn't that bad. Now even though I liked the story it was ok it's not a Wow story but an ok."
10,"Once it is set up. it makes great mortises with ease; once it is set up.  While the setup is not difficult. it is time consuming.  For me the plastic storage box is completely useless.  The box is cheap and in order to be  used the mortising attachment must be completely dissasembled.  Also. the  plastic box that came with mine seems to be made for a different version.  The part number I received is 17-924 but  it doesn't resemble the picture  on this page and it doesn't fit the moldings in the box.  It took me about  20 minutes to set up the first time and will probably take about 10 now  that I've done it.  Once set up it was as easy to use as any other drilling  operation.  To Delta's credit the manual was fairly thorough and accurate."
7,"I've had a 'passive' compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years. I'll start a new pile. and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening. I thought a more active. rapid compost would be nice. so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions. kept the pile moist. turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference. though honestly. I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster. but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter. then maybe it will work differently or better for you."

So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.

3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop. so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good. slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky. which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using. which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time. and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have. this one holds air well. It has a good bounce. and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court. but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
3,"I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L.. have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
8,"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close. even sleeping with him. However. for a reason known only to 'Igor'. he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box. but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However. since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced. I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."
6,"The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations.  The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost.  The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance.  In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet (especially when you have dozens of labels to peel!).  These new labels have an 'easy peel' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet.  Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations.*** Positive Points: ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers (I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer)- New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points: ***- None"
4,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available. it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling 'the ladies'-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda. Bob Shapiro. etc.)Basically. if you loved 'Man on the Moon'. you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
10,"This scroll saw is great:- High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!- A bit heavy for portability. but that enhances its stability.- Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws (top and bottom). no tool is required.- All user controls - on/off sw. blade tensioner. speed controller - are in the front and &quot;user friendly&quot;.- It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration. unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table. (To be fair. the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt.) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape; it will work but nothing to write home about. Maybe I should have saved the $50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw."
9,"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came 'bore-sighted' so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability. which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope. recommended!CFH"
7,"I purchased one of these feeders in the spring. along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it. this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles. while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here. it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous. but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad. and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days. so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure. but the birds sure like them."
9,"The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb 'pin' so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's. other Gerbers. CRKT's. Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife."
10,"I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase."
8,"We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?"
2,"Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.  I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results. I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse. My sofa looks brand new. smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy. but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)Thanks to this little wonder is cheap. easy to use and very effective."
4,"I taped it off of Toon Disney. I'd never heard of this movie before. but me being the Oz fan that I am. I thought I should check it out. Overall. it was a pretty good movie. I like how they developed the friedships between Wimsik and Lion and Caroline and Captain Fitzgerald. Silly is an interesting character but he lightens the movie up a bit. There are some beautiful songs even if Wimsik's voice was digitally worked to make her sound better. They depicted very well the hatred the Wicked Witch of the East had for her sister. It also has a bit of a mystery to it which was very creative. The animation was very nice. It's worth the watch! Check it out!"
12,"This type of RPG was easy to master. because at the start of the game. I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game. but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type. it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise. this game's a blast to play. with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,"I have a three year old. and a five year old. They got this movie today in the mail. and have watched it twice now. They love it! It makes sense on a level that they can understand. The story clearly describes the birth of Jesus Christ. and the true meaning of Christmas. I love the fact that the dialog and narration include actual Biblical scripture.(KJV) Wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. Grew up in a Christian home. and understood the holiday. but not at the same age as my girls now do. Movie was made by the same company and in the same style as the Burl Ives Rudolph movie with the puppets. Already a Christmas favorite to be watched with all the other holiday favorites years from now!"
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
11,"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other."
11,"This is a fantastic game! Seriously. I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did. My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format. Once we brought it out and we started playing I couldn't get enough of it. In all honesty. you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good. or you can have terrible rolls and lose early. but the game is still very fun and exciting! Turns don't take very long and so there isn't that much downtime. It's fast. fun. fairly in-depth. strategic. back-stabbing. and awesome!"
4,"This is one of the BEST RANKIN/BASS Specials!  It is heartwarming and shows the true spirit of CHRISTMAS.  Don't let anyone tell you that the material is too harsh for young children and it is still on TV during the Holidays.  This newest version of the DVD does not have the name RANKIN/BASS on the front cover as it should.  CLASSIC MEDIA should be ashamed of themselves.  This particular DVD also does not have the 35 mm print BUT this 16 A & B roll will have to suffice for now. since they have not found the 35mm print.  I Highly Recommend this DVD and I Highly Recommend that CLASSIC MEDIA/SONY WONDER give the proper credit on the next edition of this DVD."
4,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below. you MUST see the others: Love and Death. Bananas. Take the Money and Run. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask. Anie Hall. Sleeper. A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
12,"First. get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye. Mario Party. Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics. Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see. Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp. Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun. but only in groups."
7,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain. and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
6,"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a 'gift with purchase'.  It worked with both ball and optical mice. but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad. perfect size for the desk. inexpensive. and functional.  No markings or logos on it. just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."
4,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities. we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love. I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan. you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use. makes great ice cream. and the design is simple. so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price. and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content. you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this. I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use. easy to clean. simple design. great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
2,"inexpensive fan. works just fine. i bought this for white noise when i sleep. and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine. moves air too. but since that is not what i use it for. i can not speak for it's abilities at that task.side note. the fan came packed only in it's original box. and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back. got another. and. and. and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really. so i called amazon. got a 10 dollar credit. and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company. whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product. not the packaging. there is no star reduction."
4,"Wow. I saw this when it came out and wasn't really affected.  I thought of it as a horror movie with a lot of suffering.  Now that I saw it again and have accepted Jesus as my savior I feel differently about this movie.  Its beautifully done and captures what Jesus could of gone through to be our savior.It illustrates very clearly Biblical scripture into the movie.  You have to be moved to see this if not the first time. then the second.  Jesus suffered for our sins.  Through him we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  The Jews murdered him and thats why they don't want to accept Jesus as the savior.The Jews were the chosen. BEFORE Jesus came into their life.  Now. if they accept Christ. they will also be redeemed.This movie is powerful and please see it with an open mind.  You will be moved."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
11,"There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game. We came across this game while staying with my Uncle.  My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked.  I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered.  As soon as it got to our house we took it out. had some friends over and played it with them.  They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it.  We play this game at least once a week.  We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we haven't had anyone who hasn't liked it yet."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
6,"As a teacher. you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on.  This is a great way to reuse file folders.  With the True Block Technology. you can make a folder look practically new.  The labels underneath don't show through.  Of course you can use Avery's templates with this labels.  What could make it any greater?  They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer.  How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they aren't for your printer?  They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education.  Gotta love that!  Avery has done it.  The perfect label.  You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels."
9,"I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short. after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water). my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
9,"This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife. or neck knife.  Its pretty short. so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger. though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out. just not how I thought. as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine."
11,"Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers. who know how games do. and should. work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin. they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a 'build your own board' board game. Meaning that every time you play it. the game will not be the same. This lends to multiple replays. and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time. not all view it as a draw back. Few games can hold attention of players. constantly change. and live up to expectations over long prolonged games. Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game. will love Munchkin Quest. and it's original line. Munchkin Card Game."
7,"I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But. again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
2,"Quick and easy setup -- no installation required. even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last. i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality. nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend."
11,"Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really). it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice. gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose. you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise. the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game. but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall. a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon."
4,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet. sorry."
3,"This is a very short novella . Lord Alexander Beaumont goes into Whites and notices everyone is treating him oddly.He finds out his estranged wife has written an erotic book.It is written under the name of Lady Loveless and  has set the ton on edge. The book is all about their sexual escapades. They are saying it is Lady Milecent since her madiden name is used to send it to be published. He decides to go and seduce his shy and cold wife he hasn't seen her in two years.He plans on using scences from her books. She is living with her alcoholic brother and hypochondric mother.I won't give you any more details of the story you will have to read it to find out if they can get together after this time. It is short but a nice  read."
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
9,"I've been using it for about 2 months and it works great. i love it for my hair. I have Thick Curly hair. my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell. I've used this soap to wash various types of vegetables. I've washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner's Magic Pure-Castile Soap. i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner's soap. pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry. over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  . and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!"
6,". . . and it does what it is supposed to do.  I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes. it isn't the slightest bit shiny. so it disappears on packages. it's easy to tear. the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape didn't come off the serrated part and stick to itself. and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll.  My only beef -- there's not much tape on the rolls.  They're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper. in that it always looks like there's more there than you actually get.It's tape.  It's pretty good tape. and a pleasure to use. but it is just tape.  I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again. though I don't expect it to change my life."
12,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago. Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards. but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York). and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic. this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library."
6,"This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far. it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it. some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is. after all. permanent tape.  All. in all. it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
9,"I was worried that assembling would have been hard after seeing other reviews. I had my dad and brother help. turned out not needed. one helper would have been enough. as long as you take your time. and make sure the person opening the trampoline up is strong and does not let go untill you get the bolts started. recomend assembling on a flat hard surface. and before you put in the only 2 bolts that holds the frame together. make sure the two ends are seated flat together.so far with my two 55lb kids jumping on it no problems.would buy again"
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
4,"Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us. Gifted Hands is an excellent. wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film. so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this. and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story. but if so. that's your loss."
2,"I. like many people. have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his. every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt. this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans. the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
4,"Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Honestly. I really do not care about the various controversies surrounding the film... some say that Gibson's interpretation was too literal. some say that his film was a pendulum reaction to Da Vinci code where he has attempted to please the church. some have even said that the film is anti-Semitic. Honestly I don't care. I wept through most of this movie and I can't remember when I last did that (probably Schindler's List). Yes. it's bloody. But that's precisely what Gibson wanted to show... the sheer hell of the final hours of Christ. You have to own this because it's a movie that you will need to watch every now and again to remind us of the harshness of life when we start getting down with minor irritants in our everyday lives."
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
11,"If you have played other Scene It? games and had fun with them. then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version. While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books. its a limited scope and so not really for everyone (regardless of how popular Twilight is). This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game. So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
4,"This is one of those Christmas movies that you can't get through the holiday season without seeing at least once. The animation is charming and the story a classic one... This movie is a sad/sweet Christmas story that usually makes me want to cry. Why couldn't they just accept Rudolph?All about the greatness of Santa's most famous reindeer and how his 'UNUSUAL' abilitys came to use one Christmas Eve you can't help but love this small misfit little reindeer and neither can Santa.Their is something magical and charming about this classic Christmas story that makes kids believe and adults wish that they could. This is definately one of those Christmas movies that WILL never go out of style and will be around for generations. Definately a movie that you should buy if you have children or grandchildren- they'll enjoy this Christmas classic as much as you will..."
4,"The most important story apathetic Americans don't want to know.  We know through and through the sociopathic structure of Nazism as it pertained to attempting Genocide of the Jewish race. at least in all occupied territories yet we knew nothing of the Empire in the East whom inspired the Nazi Party and indeed it is difficult to find significant differences between the two totalitarian philosophies.  Shamefully. this documentary will be seen or believed by precious few in America before it's too late.  Communism was committing atrocities of the type Nazis did except they did for ~ 80 yrs.  Further. it's little known that Mao Zedong. murderer of as many as 80.000.000 of his own people who perfected the purge (of the committed ranks) long before Stalin adopted the tactic"
8,"My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic. which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars. but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge. so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down. so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall. it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water. it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low."
4,"You do not need a jumprope to do this video.  That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video.  I own the DVD.  I find it to be an excellent workout.  I bought it after doing  Tae-Bo for six months.  After doing it. my legs were sore - an indicator of  a good workout!  It has some fun combinations. with some guest instructors.  It starts out with a 15-minute warmup. during which you will do moves to  prepare you for the kicks.  A long warmup is necessary before jumping into  heavy cardio.  Then. you start with punches. move onto kicks. and  combinations.  My only complaint is that the punching drills can become  boring.  If I lost my gym membership. I would begin to do this video at  frequent intervals again."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
9,"Before this purchase my idea of sharpening knives are sliding the blade thru an electric sharpener made by chef mate.While it does the job well i totally ruined a Cold steel Recon tanto knife.I purchased this because of the reviews and the video.And after playing around with it i got to sharpen my Cold steel knife back to the way it came...well almost but its really sharp.My observation specially with the folding knife is the coarse actually provide a better edge than the fine.Like i mentioned its my first time doing it and so far im really happy with it.Now im looking around the house finding something to sharpen LOL.Bottom line if you want a sharpener thats easy to use look no further.Im going to order another one for camping and the other one stays in the kitchen."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
8,"I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18' handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued. only the 14' handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18' handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the 'fun' category. On the other hand the 18' handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18' handle. The reviews are correct. the 18' handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14' handles."
2,"It's a ricer. there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.  It's basically a large garlic press that you can use to make smooth mashed potatoes. assuming you don't know what a ricer is.The quality of construction is good. the ease of use is good. and the price is good.  I wish there was more to talk about. but the device is just too simple to get really in depth.One down side would be the ricer could be a tad bigger so you can rice more potato at a time. but its not bad.I would buy this again."
6,"You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in. With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good. solid. dependable product. The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you won't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most."
1,"I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics. it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back. I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit."
6,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However. for my application. I need to fed one sheet multiple times. as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately. with these Avery labels. after I feed them a couple times. the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet. but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So. if you plan to print one sheet at a time. this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time. look for another product."
2,"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers. and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position. so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well. the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine. so it's useless.On top of the danger. it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!"
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
12,"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics. levels. and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game. this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer. a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer. a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives. and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score. gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
9,"My friend has this for her son. and her new puppy fell in love with it. so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So. I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it. but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing. running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones. but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
8,"Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky. a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING."
12,"I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color.  if your buying a game boy color you won't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it."
9,"There are many cheap red dot sights out there. but few are as tough and that exhibit any kind of quality better than the Bushnell trophy series red dot sights. This one is great as it offers 11 brightness setting and 4 different types of reticles. This little guy is light and compact yet very tough. and comes with a sun shade for very bright outdoor settings. Although it uses mounting rings. they hold the scope in place very well and the sight maintains zero very well. Had mine on my ar-15 for 2.5 years now and never had to re-sight it in. It is still as accurate as it was day one! I have not changed the battery yet either after 2.5 years and it is still going strong. AWESOME battery life. A+"
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
4,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall. despite.some silly moments & plot holes.it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
8,"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched 'tasty pastes' available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before. we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the 'pasty Kongs' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' 'tasty pastes' - it's easy to use. doesn't seem to make a mess. and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it '2 paws up'!"
8,"Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill. that when chewed. he cries out 'Oh nooooooo!' just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady. my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago. she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again. but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is. because of the 'Mr. Bill' sound-maker. it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer. but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more. just to have on hand. in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)"
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
7,"For years. I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out. the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding. the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool. but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you. disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"
8,"Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers'. this toy is wonderful!  Yes. they can.. and will. eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it. but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs. and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums. and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!"
1,"You open your Braun cleaning station. slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor. it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China. filled with alcohol. coloring. and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
1,"Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars. this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar. chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it. and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information. these bars do have a lot of protein (15g). but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
2,"It's been a month and so far. so good. with this OXO ice cream scoop.  The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.  Also. the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part. so I'm happy about that. and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still.  We're washing it in the dishwasher. so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all. if you need an ice cream scoop. this does the job nicely.*Update: February 2012*  It's been 8 months. still looks like new."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
11,"For the first time in the 10 Days series. you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today."
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
7,"I had used rockwool. but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched. but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation. but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat.&#34; which is convenient."
4,"This video does a great job teaching the alphabet - the conceit is that Baby Bear can't get all the way through saying the alphabet. while Big Bird and the gang help him learn it.  Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like 'J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans.' and. my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing 'D.'  An incredibly funny clip.So. this video does its job all the way around - teaches and entertains!  Enjoy!"
6,"I've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards. They work good on either my inkjet when I want color. or my laser jet. There is a template on Microsoft Word (Avery 5160)that makes creating the labels very easy. The size is just enough for name and address. There is no room to add Clip Art. You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture. Now that I have these labels. I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also. there are so many labels (3000) in the box. that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope."
6,"There are many applications for this tape. but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example. mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also. while this is meant as permanent tape. the foam layer can. in some applications. give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing. nailing. sewing. velcroing. etc."
2,"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color. and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated. of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored. foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book. and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies. and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!"
6,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec. you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers. 1 x 2-5/8 Inches. Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you ' Pop-up Edge for fast peeling'. I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
3,"Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR"
7,"I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees. it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily. longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them. only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many."
8,"Many products are not safe... like Hartz. and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats. and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage. and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog. and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles. or fleas in my home !!"
1,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray. it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the 'job' for me!"
11,"My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle.  The puzzle has 24 large. thick pieces which were easy to fit together.  The puzzle and box are sturdy. and the box has a convenient rope handle.  The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have. and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores.  As you can tell from the box. the animals are more cartoonish than realistic. but pleasant enough.  Both sides. even the back. of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well.  Recommended."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
4,"Mel Gibson is an ok actor but his real talent is directing and movies like THE PASSION OF CHRIST or APOCALYPTO prove it. BRAVEHEART was quite good. too. but he's outdone himself with THE PASSION OF CHRIST.First of all. using Aramaic instead of English - thank you! Brilliant and brave idea!Secondly. casting Jim Caviezel as Jesus. stroke of a genius. this actor is absolutely believable in his role.And finally not shunning away from EXCESSIVE and prolonged violence. Think what you will of onscreen violence. but in this film it's a must. Christ's suffering and his sacrifice do not come across as well without these violent scenes. which is why other movies about the crucifixion are not as powerful as Gibson's film.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is definitely not for children and without the religious context this would have most definitely been an NC-17."
4,"The movie is punctuated by unfortunate series of continuous beating. Any human being with massive strength would not have been able to sustain such number of flagellations using whips with pointed hooks and nails.The holy Bible does NOT refer to the degree of such ill-treatments. for example the 'scene' when the Cross was 'trundled' on the hill and fell on the dusty ground. with Christ face down.Even the 'abduction' of Christ was transformed into a frenzied activity with exaggerations when they hit Him repeatedly so as to inflict pain until He fell over the road side. chained.We know the Camera can do marvels. but behind it there ought to be reasonable interpretation of events that should take precedence over smart technology."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
8,"Still a work in progress. I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However. the quest is still in progress. since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right. I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition. I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold). requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
11,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product. the programmable Rover. that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product. as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However. now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review. even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review..."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"We purchased our 'Elf' after everyone was talking about it at preschool. Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids' behavior (We have a 4.3 and 1 year old) It wasn't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble. My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy. When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on. It really works!! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning. We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we don't read the book. My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it's a great idea and it really works with our kids."
3,"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions. curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter. more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
2,"When I was a kid. my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity. dubious reliability.  The run-of-the-mill manual openers weren't much better; they would usually slip. failing to turn the can and open it.Enter the GoodGrips can opener - I picked one of these up over a year ago. and it's functioned perfectly ever since.  The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers. though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.  The rubber handles are very comfortable. and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.  Simple and inexpensive but effective - I've been very satisfied with this product.In fact. it was so good I gave one to my mother. and she hasn't complained about it a bit!"
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
9,"I really put this knife through the ringer. I tend to abuse my knives and let me tell you this one can put up with it. I wrote another review on this knife and said it was like a toy. I now retract that statement. This is a real knife. and it will hold up to just about anything you can do to it. SOG. keep 'em comin'... I will buy more SOG knives. By the way. this knife is made in the USA! Not all SOGs are. but all of the assisted opening ones are. I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?"
4,"Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70.s.Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live."
6,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint. which is minor. is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that. I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
7,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips. but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different."
3,"Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available."
4,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However. it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit. and partly to my own blame. I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in. but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called 'must have Christmas movies' then pass it up for another title."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
4,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well. even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but. have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
12,"The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche. They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy. you wont find that out until later in the game. I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made.!"
7,"This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage. I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all. and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size. but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light. but very nicely made."
9,"Basic Victorinox quality but with an added twist. The wooden grips look really nice and feel nice in the hand. Gives an every day carry knife like the spartan a real classy look. Was impressed that they milled out the recesses for the tooth pick and tweezers both of which fit fine. No hole for the pin though. Wood seemed a little dry so I added some lemon oil. I would have preferred they had the tinker in a wooden handle version because I'm not a big fan of the corkscrew. But I added the micro screwdriver in the corkscrew for added versatility. A real bargain for a wood-handled version (compared to Wenger wood handled offerings)"
11,"This is a fun game. and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number. no matter what the color. be the player that loses makes for some great 'take that' blocking opportunities. Also. for parents of children. my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also. the box is designed well to house all the components. which are also very well made."
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
1,"Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
2,"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker. hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use. just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean. as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!"
6,"My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled. which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1. so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly. easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
8,"My dog loves these treats. I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages. no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products."
3,"Prequel to the series. this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact. you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series. you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot. sensual. dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside. like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe."
1,"I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl. then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well. as prescribed also."
8,"We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area. she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas. it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
4,"This film. beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ. never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing. violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views. Mel Gibson. a schizo if there ever was one. does not seem to know how to separate history from his half-deluded gospel scenes.Most of the story centers around Christ. who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious 'crucifixion' which 'saved man'. but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since. especially by the Catholic Church.Avoid at all costs. unless you are a fanatical Christian."
4,"Can't believe I'd never seen this before 2013...every middle school and high school kid should be REQUIRED to view this film once each day for about a year or UNTIL they stop wasting their lives playing video games. watching TV and 'hanging out' and. instead. are inspired to put forth as much effort as Dr. Carson did. If he can go from the 'dumbest' kid in his class. with a single mom. living in poverty and eventually achieve such miracles by his own hands...then anyone can do the same. There are millions of kids who are wasting their lives away who need to see this movie. Can you tell I LOVED it?"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
6,"This is a well-designed. simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large. easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time. and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g.. has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
8,"Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and 'wants to be doing something.'  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little 'age' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing. you get the little 'plastic spikes' that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!"
9,"Been looking around for a useful little knife with a couple of cutting blades. a flat head and Phillips screwdriver. and a can opener in a pocket-friendly form factor that I can carry at work and everywhere else. one that if I drag it out and deploy a cutting edge to open a box or package or something. people won't run screaming into the streets. This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field. beside a creek. or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for. It's enough knife for the discreet everyday chores it's meant to handle. and it's thin and unobtrusive riding in the coin/watch pocket of my denim jeans. Life is good."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
9,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the 'X' model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the 'steel' plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the 'X' model and purchased the 'RS' model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
12,"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics. cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money. but of course. I wait till the games are 'old hat' and buy them cheaper.The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope. I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal. but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars. I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game. as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the 'extras'. that should have been in the game to begin with."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
4,"As the title says. unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him. which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife. Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
9,"My first pocket knife when I was growing up was a SAK explorer. you know the bulky model that had everything. and I love it. unfortunately when your young you are also more careless and of course I lost it. I was devestated. and since back then they were pricer my Dad would not fork over for a new one. undertandably. Well twentysome years later and I finally replaced my lost SAK. this time its the Fieldmaster. I love to camp and this model has all the tools I need without being too bulky and heavy. the quality is still great. the polished stainless steel is a thing of beauty and all and all a this is the quintessential pocket knife!."
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
1,"These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this. I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning. raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call. I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can."
4,"I love this movie. and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was. and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul. and she knew what a person could achieve in life. with dedication. and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson. but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love. and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many. many times. Never tire of it."
7,"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal. set the vents. and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good. try their best menu item and compare it to the 'Q' you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs. meatloaf. pork butt. spare ribs. and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it. you won't regret it."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
9,"As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However. this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes."
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
7,"This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck. period._Bottom Line_ Yes. I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!"
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
8,"We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions. then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;. I was AMAZED to find that. 15 hours later. heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way. so that it emits a low heat all night through."
9,"fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100."
4,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this movie. as it is one of those movies that are well made. but simply unenjoyable. I say this because watching the torture of a righteous man. the son of God. is simply hard to see.As a movie. there isn't much to this. However. this is a historically accurate movie that portrays the death of Christ very accurately. as well as the suffering he went through. Much of it is horrific and hard to watch. thus the 'R' rating.I strongly discourage younger viewers from seeing this movie. If you're looking for enjoyment. don't watch this either. I do recommend everyone watching this at least once though. simply to understand it's content and what Christians believe."
6,"Breathed new life into my shredder............. Mine was getting stuck and binding up. Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth. or 'back it out' and re-try.  Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and didn't cut the tip off) and drizzled it along the teeth.  Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life.  I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months. and the bottle I got was huge.  Will last me the rest of this shredders life.  Got the product very fast too. thanks to my Prime Membership"
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
2,"This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair. broken wine glasses (who said that? :). leaves that blow into the house. crumbs. party remnants. etc.... I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well. if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5&#34;5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par."
11,"Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone. The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability. Everyone appreciates it's pacing as well. as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players. This expansion. Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features. It essentially adds two possible new game modes. One simply expands upon the base game. adding more challenging but more rewarding quests. new lord cards. and new buildings. The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun. and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you've played it often with the same group. All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game. If you enjoyed the base game. this is a must have expansion. and a great value for the price."
3,"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really. ridiculous!"
12,"This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very. very. hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful."
7,"These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small. outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good. I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally. I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars."
2,"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make 'Ice Cream' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry 'ice cream' using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first."
9,"I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out. it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter. but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection."
8,"...between this product and Advantix. depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats. but we have to reapply flea meds every month. so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate. or . . . well. I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously. so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still. it does seem to kill the adults very quickly. as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application."
11,"So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing. or another rubbing it in as a bad winner. etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that. does it well. and comes with TONS of minis. missions. etc. That said. it's designed very well. the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions. but for some reason unlike some other games we own. the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something. but that's just my 2 cents."
12,"This game is really good. It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly. turn invisible and go through certain types of walls. and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64. you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks."
3,"When Alexandra 'Sasha' DeStephano is summoned to a special meeting to appear in front of her elders. she has no idea she is being placed into a power struggle.  She soon finds herself promoted to Tiger Queen.Colton 'Cole' Reyes. a rogue alpha. steps in to help her.  He thinks she is their only hope to bring new leadership to the pack.  In order to protect her and get through the night he suggests she pretend to be his mate.  However. Sasha does not want to keep pretending.Tiger by the Tail is sexy and fast-paced with the alpha hero in an awkward position trying to get her pack back on track and fighting the current leadership.  Cole and Sasha's chemistry is immediate and they soon realize what they mean to each other.  I loved Sasha's wicked humor and Cole is a wonderful alpha and a perfect match for Sasha.  Tiger by the Tail is a great summer read.Vivianreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
8,"My dogs love this food. it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price. as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon. it qualifies for free shipping. which makes it even more appealing! Thanks. Patti Roth"
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
6,"When working properly. these are wonderful calculators: affordable. simple to learn. fuctional. small. comes with case. easy to reset the memory. etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin. cos. and tan buttons. but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end. sci/eng. right. enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once. you'll be fine.Occasionally. there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case. you have to be extra careful when inputting data. but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class."
12,"Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over. Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game. Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth. The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so. those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games. will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can."
1,"I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while. long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in. it must have been about two months ago. it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year. not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth."
8,"Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed. I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon. as I call it. is made of cheap plastic. but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one."
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
11,"Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players. Three or more is ideal. Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill. You may keep one route. or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to &#34;buy&#34; your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much. we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!"
4,"haha  a horror movie?  hmm perhaps.the funny thing is. according to your bible. that's HOW IT HAPPEND.the fact is. no one should be getting offended by this movie.  wah wah it's too violent.  fine. then don't watch.  just because it's about jesus doesn't mean you hafta pay for a ticket.  the advertising for this movie is insane. so don't tell me you didn't KNOW it was going to be violent.  and if you wanted a non-violent movie. maybe you should go watch a comedy.  not a movie about jesus being HUNG ON A CROSS. STABBED. AND BEATEN.  guess what?  according to that book you believe. THAT'S WHAT HAPPEND TO HIM.  did you want Mel Gibson to put up a fake portrayal of what happend????oh. yeah.  and the movie was really good.  i don't even believe this stuff. but it was very emotional. and worth seeing."
2,"This is an easy corer to use. You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple. Peel first or not. Sometimes you get a wonky apple and the core misses a few seeds but that can be handled when you quarter the apple (a bit of trimming with the paring knife.) This is fast. I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better. It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better. It's actually faster and cleaner to use the paring knife to cut the apple wedges if that's what you want.The handle is nice and grippy and thick for a good grip as you push it into the apple. and the blade is sharpe enough to easy penetrate the fruit and push out the core. I use this all the time."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
8,"My mom suffers some age-related joint pain. and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help. and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy. it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect. or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather. activity levels. diet. etc. but it seems like it may help. and it doesn't hurt."
3,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series. even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
4,"I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !"
9,"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information. but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor. just the handles."
11,"This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it. especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night."
7,"This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time. and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs. a 15 pound brisket. or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat. causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!"
11,"I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it.  After two plays. she decided that. nope. it was not her thing;  she didn't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I'm not sure why -- buying & selling. etc. do not usually interest me but this game is great fun.  Elves. dwarves. gnomes. a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game.  It has one of the best rule books I've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
7,"No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight. strong enough for moderate trimming. and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill. use it. plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord. but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!"
2,"My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.  Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.  This scoop works so much better. even without running it under hot water first!  The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material. and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me.  i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.  Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
8,"We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately. our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually. she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However. we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second."
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
11,"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling 'Speed Scrabble' for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn. he yells 'Draw 2!' and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles. like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people. it does help to have two sets of tiles. of course."
4,"this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles. which i feel would have been more authentic.  however. it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out. it was definitely enjoyable."
3,"This was a book of many wonderful Indian fairy tales. It includes tales both of a 'classical' fairy tale style and ones that are moralistic folktales instead.

7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"If they made more games like this. I'd be a pauper. Intelligent. funny. easy to use. easy to solve. and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking. gorgeous. well-written. and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed. so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble. though."
11,"Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles.  I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they don't line it up right and can't get the lid on. The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle 'At the Zoo' is a fun open interpretation.  It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place.  My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend 'At the Zoo' or any of Mudpuppy's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages."
6,"I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use. and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors.  This calculator was required. by name. for a class I am taking. and I begrudgingly bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I can't believe how easy it is to use.  I still like excel or just doing the math (for simple TVM procedures). but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made. cleanly designed. and a worthwhile purchase."
11,"For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game.  My son is 7.  Fortunately. there are Basic and Advanced rules.  I found the Basic rules were sufficiently &#34;difficult&#34; and understandable.  We play with just three players. but it's easy to see how more players = more fun.  I happen to drive a manual transmission (and 6-speed to boot. just like the game) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself. with the only the sound of tumbling dice.  Wonderful."
1,"Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much. I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration. but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now. I used to apply it every singe night before bed. but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering. even if you haven't shaved your underarms. it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida. my underarms are still dry!"
7,"We've had continual issues with deer. rabbits. squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers. vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers. several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled. with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side. the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note. the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking. but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks. don't waist your time."
12,"Ya know. I remember playing this game as a kid.I couldn't find this game anywhere. and I didn't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version. so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline. and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones. then you'd love this game.Pros (or cons):Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think (don't worry because it's not like Balder's Gate or anything that brainstorming ;)Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons (or pros):Low quality graphics (then again it is from the PS1. so don't expect 128 bit graphics;)No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally. I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I've known complained about.Also. if anyone buys this game. then I have to tell you this: Please. if you're gonna use cheats... Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>"
6,"I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper.  I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive.  The quality of this paper is OK. heavier than standard paper. and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good.  The thing is. I cut down the price per piece. by also using a lot of white space. from over $2 apiece to about .50. without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper. saturated business graphics look good. your vacation shots will not.For the price. give it a try for graphics."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
6,"Unlike other return address labels. these Avery labels have an innovative 'easy peel' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. It's so well designed. you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers. these labels print crisply. dry quickly. and avoid smudging.As many have noted. the small size of these labels doesn't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings. You'll want to use the Avery template 5167 (free download from Avery. built into most other software including Microsoft Word) to start. Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings. Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels isn't for everyone - there's not much room for a custom graphic or logo. But that's why Avery offers multiple product choices!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
4,"'The Visual Bible: Matthew DVD' is a visual Bible using the 1984 New International Version translation of the gospel of Matthew with a 4 hour 20 minute run time. The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew. like an audio Bible. which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes. settings. and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed. sad when people reject His message. playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!). and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect. but I really enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend this resource as an enjoyable and thought-provoking way to 'read' Matthew."
1,"Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results. you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!"
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers). I shouldn't have spent so much money on this. The quality & design is worth about $25 in my opinion. not what I ended up paying. even on a lightening deal.I'm worried this thing won't last and that it will break at what seems like a weak point where the supports hold the clear plastic piece.So based on the poor value & that it seems it will break at the 'weak point'. I only feel comfortable giving this 2 stars.UPDATE 2013-03-15: My wife has been using this and so far it's been working well. I'm still concerned about it breaking and don't think the design is the best and still don't think it's worth the current price. but it's holding up and I haven't heard any complaints from my wife. Therefore. I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars."
2,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered. as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use. peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be. making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large. comfortable. and steady."
8,"I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times. scrapings were done. negative. blood & stool. negative.  He was looking very puny. my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However. we had an amazing breeder. and he told us about Nupro gold. and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
3,"Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi. I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters. good writing. a little horror. a little medical. it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days. and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I. for one. can't wait!"
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
7,"Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back. but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer. but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer. but again. you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby. but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby."
9,"Like countless other dads over the years i got this for my ten year old for his first pocket knife and he loved it before announcing that it was too small and inquiring as to the possibility of obtaining a switch blade to replace it.  After a brief but intense discussion. he is now quite happy to still have access to this little tool.  What can really be said about a product like this other than &#34;it lives up to it's reputation&#34;.  The company and the product have been around forever and it does exactly what you would expect it to.  No one is going to cut down a tree. or cut anything more substantial than some heavy twine with this but it's a great introduction to responsible tool ownership and use and an essential accessory for every well rounded American boy."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
1,"We've used these for years but most recently. they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist. he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well."
9,"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a 'knife.'  Like other Swiss army knives. there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything. but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away.  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break. and you'll lose the toothpick. the tweezers. or both.  Then. perhaps. it's time for a replacement.  Until then. however. you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"
3,"This was one very good book.  It will draw you in. then it won't let you go until the problems have been resolved.  I will read more by Kevin O'Kane.  His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage. this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.  Though I've become much more lenient over the years. constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable.  This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events.  It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read."
8,"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models. I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box. but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs. they're small cats. so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates. but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section. wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter. it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
11,"What cute graphics on this puzzle! My animal loving girls (3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion. This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds!"
2,"Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
6,"These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification."
8,"Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy. and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground. thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe. although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore. because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
12,"This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game. not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much. it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game."
4,"Discerning viewers. not distracted by production values not on par with multimillion  dollar Hollywood productions. will find in this film a message fitting for our times. This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures. or scrambling for help from government or extended family. this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour. Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question. As America descends into the abyss. what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians. the life savings and benevolence of friends and family. or the living Lord?"
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
3,"46.220 locations - 14 stories.  Active Table of Contents.  Just an incredible value.If you have a Kindle and like to read at all. and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read. I highly recommend giving this a try.  I don't recall what I paid for it. but it's 14 full stories about Oz by the original author.  Currently for less than a dollar.  I have to adjust the size down one for this book. compared to most others. but that is a tiny complaint.If all you know about Oz is the original movie. give this a try and find a more complicated world and characters then you thought.  Love the author's notes."
1,"I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."
12,"posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great. u may think u should just rent it. but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio. and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line. great wepons. great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this."
11,"We bought 3 new games for family game nights :)  We saw episodes of Will Wheaton's youtube show. TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun (Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two).  Out of the three. this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use :)  Phrases. a song. a tune. a movie or book title...  It is a good test for one's knowledge. too (which is good for my kid hehe)...  We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge.  I hope they make expansions for it!"
9,"I bought two (2) pair of this goggles (clear lens. cherry) nov. 2009 for my 3 and 5 years old daughters. from Amazon. at $16.56 each one.Don't doubt it: &iexcl;SPECTACULAR! goggles.ProThe frame is really flexible and comfortable for kids face.The ample visibility of the curved lens doesn't scare small kids. they don't feel claustrophobic.Watertight fit is GREAT: Just make sure that hair is out of the frame and I can assure that it doesn't leak.Strap is very easy to adjust. nice mechanism.Easy to put on: My daughters could do it alone after a few attempts.ConNot everlasting: After heavy use (3 - 4 times per week in the swimming pool) in hot weather (sun. etc) the frame material showed cracks until water leakage begun. End of the goggles. But they lasted 18 months (less than $1 per month = bargain for me).ok. enjoy. bye."
11,"This isn't a game to sit down and play with your friends or family. It gets very chaotic and isn't much fun. But as an ice-breaker at a party while people are going about other things at the same time I expect it would be fun.The idea of the game is to try to get the most beads by finding people that fit a certain specification or getting people to do or say certain things. Everyone steals beads from everyone else and the player with the most beads at the end of the time (you can set the time for whatever you want) wins. The great thing about this game is if you wanted to you could easily buy more beads to play with.If you are looking for an ice-breaker game. I would recommend this. Otherwise you might be disappointed."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
1,"I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible. but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try. but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day. for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand. and to be completely honest. I believe petroleum jelly. aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day. for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma). since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes. but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy. I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money."
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
4,"While to some the scenes of violence may be seen as excessive the emotional impact balanced it out it was never violence for the sake of violence but to show or attempt to show some of christs enourmous suffering. The scene with Mary picking Jesus up will soften most of the most hardened hearts. I love many of the 50's type bible epics but this one was the first to promote a real emotional connection. the fact thats its no in english will not bother you it actually enhances the film Mel gibson has hit the bash train latley I enjoy the majority of the films he directs the music the emotion and the fire i really appreciate about the guys films."
2,"I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up."
4,"The Passion of The Christ. dealing with the last days of Jesus's life. is a supreme example of religous mokery. If you're not a Christian there's no reason to see this film because you will be left confused and most likely frustrated by all its apparent flaws. There's scene after scene of Jews beating Jesus. laughing at his pain. mixed with a few characters that have sympathy for the dieing figure; that's basicly what you get. As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent. but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable. and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast. I found it repetive and boarderling antisemetic. If you're not in the films prime audiance than you definetly don't have to see it."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
1,"First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily. you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks"
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
6,"The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful.  The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten.  My wife is a school teacher and my daughter. although she. too taught in public schools. now stays home and home schools our grand daughters.  Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff.  These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them.  My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more.  They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated.  I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children.  They are compact. efficient and just great to have around."
6,"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful.  The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem. so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers.  You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise. the 'Easy Peel'.  Peel one label off a sheet. and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."
6,"These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.  The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label.  The size is perfect for packages. and they don't smudge easily.  I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  These labels can be peeled off without much effort. which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box. but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.  An easy solution (though perhaps not very elegant) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels. and I think the price is reasonable.  Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these. which I would gladly give five stars."
4,"I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously. because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
9,"I have put these together before.  It's hard. but not awful.The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult.  THREE.  Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time?  Almost never.  So. needless to say. it's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up.My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together. and finally gave up.THEN. the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say &#34;Keep away from open flame&#34;.  But. I think this is more like &#34;Do not light a match while this is in the room&#34;."
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel. With Soothing Aloe. 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day. and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists. and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well. delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray. and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
12,"It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying 'duh'.  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!"
4,"This parody on &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; mixed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time. he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately. the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him. he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.The DVD is well done. but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
11,"Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough. that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything. but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing. so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
7,"I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes. it works well in small places. and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string. and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review"
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
8,"My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby. 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though. don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all. I think they are just best for toy breed dogs. Bella is 6 pounds."
6,"These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You. Invitation. X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers. I have used them in Dell. Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product. saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card."
7,"I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice. simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it."
9,"So. my hubby and sons use it for body and hair and it sure does the job well!  Great for a feel-fresh anytime feeling of cool. this rinses away clean and the refreshing smell is invigorating. but dissipates quickly enough that it isn't overwhelming.  The guys have buzz cuts. so it is perfect for hair and body and we dilute it for use in foaming hand-soap dispensers as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair. as I believe something more buffered with conditioners would be better suited.  All in all. it is great for multi-uses. goes a long way diluted. and washes away clean.  Even my ultra sensitive skin responds well . . . A great value on Amazon - you can save LOTS OF $$$$ using this product."
8,"We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first."
12,"this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
2,"I have had these for a couple years. and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy. and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy. cool grip.I have one minor complaint. the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example. with chicken parmesan. the breading rips right off. Now. we'll eat anything. so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods."
3,"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital. why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them. yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also. why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career. and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her. acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying. why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people. and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief. but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
2,"I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130."
2,"I LOVE THIS VACUUM. it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old 'tank' design as opposed to the current square 'canister' design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord. massive suction. long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
12,"first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun. second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU!!!!and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S. the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares .HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO.OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD"
8,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy. they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
3,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line. I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes. with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber. their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian. but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice. hot. hunky. hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
6,"This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items. but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. For heavier items. I put more on the back of the wall hanging. or object. and on lighter items I use less. Also. it really sticks to ceramic. even if it has a glossy glaze! Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use. but with this product. only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream. I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement. and it was easy to lift them off the wall. without tearing the paint. and move them. (I think when dry. and 'set' they might not be so easy to move. because the tape is so sticky. so we'll see.) Excellent. effective. and easy to use product! Recommended."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
2,"This will be short. it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums. it's OEM. it works. no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size. I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run. and it has been running for over a decade. I will get these replacements. Thanks to Amazon for making these so easy to acquire. would have had a hard time locally. otherwise.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
6,"PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It's going to hold open most books. Which is what you want.Doesn't cover the bottom of book like some book holders. Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep. so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk. It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks. Unlike some book holders. there is no book overhang over the edge. due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak. Like it can too easily fold in on itself. But it hasn't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost."
1,"This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads 'low' I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3. but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large. smashed. under-protected box. the 5 stars is for the quality product. convenience. and ease of use. Very easy to insert. use. and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL."
12,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS. SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS. OR I should REALLY say is. &quot;Beanie Baby&quot;. and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY. this game should surplus 5 stars. I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1.000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly. I WANTED TO SEE PIT &quot;KID ICARUS&quot; IN THIS GAME. MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask. ask. ask! PRETTY SOON. THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND &quot;DAI-BIYESSO. DAI-BIYE!&quot; (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
3,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book. first printed in 1912. is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers. the ship. the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts. and. paradoxically. one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
7,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly. it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also. the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out. but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
10,"I'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw. I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting. it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to 'try' to use. the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line. the way its supposed to be."
8,"My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat. but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps. and therefore they can't use things like corn. wheat. or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also. there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system."
7,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break. I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog. does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much. but the scoop holds a lot. and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong. has a nice finish to it. it's easy to use. and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice. I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
7,"I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it. and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality. cost (no gas) and quick startup. it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well. was very quiet."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
12,"I'm what gamers call a 'Zelda Veteran' . I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging. different and fun to play.In this one. Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider. the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda. the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble. and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi. a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures. Link will learn spells. be swallowed by a huge fish. and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
7,"This is not what you want for heavy duty wear. like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener. with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half. these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty. too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice. I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
10,"I bought this sander to replace a 3&#34; x 18&#34; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop."
6,"Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains."
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
3,"I'll be honest..this isn't a 5 star book.  But it didn't deserve all the one star ratings out there and it doesn't deserve the average three star rating it has as of this posting.  I gave it a 5 to help even out the score.  There are some awful 1-3 star kindle books out there. and this just isn't one of them.  The book is kind of silly and FULL of ranchy sexy goodness.  The characters aren't annoying and the book is written well (not by a dyslexic monkey who may or may not be a fan-fic tween - like some books).Give it a shot.  I liked it enough to look up the other books in the series.  Maybe you will like it too."
2,"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about 'stainless steel' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made. top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes. and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog. and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously."
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
7,"This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews. the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless. the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill."
5,"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on. which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch. so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle. and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah. but in my experience. the sound is equivalent on the base models."
2,"This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable.  I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil.  The bad thing is that it's not the most durable.  For the most durable. you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop.  This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream.  This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through.  Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop.  This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
2,"I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments.  Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill.  Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably  it remained on longer than necessary. to the detriment of my electricity bill.  The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.  I realize that nothing last forever. but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods. but I see no benefit in buying one of them.  This timer gives me the option of a full hour. but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer. this is a very good choice."
8,"I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper). smells like beef gravy. but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone. so do I."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
8,"This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him. and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her. get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible. this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on. even though he has chewed a bit off of it."
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
3,"By Gwen S. .San Marcos CA... We are finally reading  the tale about Anna G. . the third saga of the Women of Brambleberry House. Sage's and Julia's sagas were well written  with well developed characters  and story plots but in Soldier's Secret. I felt disconnected with Anna's personna so my interest in reading this book to its conclusion waned exponentially as I plodded through  it but I read it to the very end...I did! Max. Abigail's wounded veteran /nephew. on the other hand captured my sympathy as a recently wounded. helio-flying medic/ veteran in recovery phase. And Abigail. even in death. managed to get Anna and Max together as a couple with the help of Conan. the mutt. Anticlimatic story to the trilogy."
11,"This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn.  Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays. which keeps it interesting. A great game for all ages. even if all of them don't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box.  The yellow is more chartreuse (yuck) and the orange is not very bright.  If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table. they're not visually very acute.  Our table has overhead lighting. so it's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile. as described."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
5,"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school. Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles. this pedal has a great. warm. organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth. or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
3,"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists. dreamers. hard working folks. bigger than life characters. and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder. be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer."
2,"I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.  This has great grip. great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).  Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.  It's heavy but really well balanced so I think that combination might be what helps it to cut so well.Would buy it again & highly recommend it.Note - it is big - think they said 4'.  Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.  I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
6,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case. packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted. part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However. overall it's a fine product."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
7,"These did not fit my feeder. but I super-glued them in place. The 'basket' part also falls off of the 'stem' part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue. so if you try this work-around. be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry. too.I like feeding bees. and they have their own plate of sugar water. but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky. although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today. a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it. bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems. I guess!"
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product. I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose. and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist. 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review"
10,"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags. they are fine.  About 95% have no problem. but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight. they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these. but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers. but they don't. so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value."
8,"I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
3,"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his 'stuff' for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends. just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
10,"Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet.  This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss. and is lightweight and easy to use.  Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4' worm drive. so I grab the 5 1/2' skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size. and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way. it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet. go back to the kitchen."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
2,"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues. but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy. but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws. so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you. put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable. but it exhausts air much better than it draws air. and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed. which is how we run it anyway."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell. but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator. which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack. which feels like hot lava."
3,"This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure. but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?"
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
10,"I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit. but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle. you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what. this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool."
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
5,"One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13' model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth. so once the angle is set and the knob tightened. it will not slip.  Get the 13' if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7' is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length."
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
1,"There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday. once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer. it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
5,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't. it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic. I use it for instruments. vocals. even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals. but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned. and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably. then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon. but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics. you can't go wrong here."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
7,"These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants. herb garden. seasonal flowers. small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."
1,"These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use. and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned. not sure why that is. Amazon 'subscribe and save' is a great way to save money on this product. since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience."
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
7,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season. and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets. since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead. it uses egg to make it smell like something dead. and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it. it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact. this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product. so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome. but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet. and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
9,"This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends. the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well. you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it. people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well. you can do long. straight throws with it.And as a bonus. the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)"
9,"I love these little seven function knives which are made in Switzerland.  It fits easily in any pocket even attached to a keychain.  The tools are: knife. nail file. screwdriver. scissors. tweezers. toothpick. and key ring. Although it's not big. I have found that it can be adapted to do many things. The knife you have &#34;with you&#34; is much better than the bigger one you left at home.  The scissors and the knife blade are quite sharp and are made from good steel.  A friend that I gave one to discovered a new use.  If you pluck the tweezers like a tuning fork it makes a musical note.  Great if you can sing. The white color is very nice looking."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
3,"In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories. Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them. Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together. In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots. shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy. A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
11,"This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old.  The Consensus from everyone was that it wouldn't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat.  The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do.  Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads.  This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage."
7,"I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners.then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe.then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight.extremely sharp.easy to maneuver.and once again.Fiskars.still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality.lifetime guarantee.great addition.Can't find a fault.including a very fair price."
5,"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones. where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire."
11,"There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason. This game is very fun and simple to teach new people. I've taught many of my family members how to play and they've all enjoyed it. I still need to purchase a few of the expansions. which would really open the game up a lot. but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby. you can't beat this starter set. The mechanics are super fun and streamlined. You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game. I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles. I highly recommend this game."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
10,"I have used one of these for five or six years now. It is very strong and very tuff; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great. I use two of them constantly. but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill. strong but not too heavy or bulky; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such. when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong."

1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
11,"Intended for 4 to 12 players. Party Gras encourages interaction with family. friends. and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party. celebration. etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill. thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.The idea is very good. but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think 'Did they just put that in the card?' And. that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.  If you want outrageous. ridiculous. but still fun action cards. I recommendQuelf Board Game.Overall. a game that had lots of potential. but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
6,"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently. TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However. the calculator is complicated to use. and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore. the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there. and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead."
1,"I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal. and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums. and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit. it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea. but the others worked much. much better for me.  I would not recommend these."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
2,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also. I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender. pour it into the frozen bowl. turn it on. & 25 minutes later. you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
6,"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble. but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8' thick as well.And. no. I wouldn't buy another."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
3,"Number of illustrations promised before purchase: 10Number of illustrations visible on my Kindle: 0Good part: the Table of Contents works for me.  I can go forward and back to next book (but not next chapter).Bad part: giant lump of text is tedious to read without any pictures.This edition includes the text of 14 books plus one bonus book: Wogglebug's adventures in the real world.  The Wogglebug book is dreadful and not worth reading.This edition is good if you have already read the Oz books and are re-reading them for your own pleasure (i.e. not reading them to someone else).  Otherwise. sorry. losing the pictures really takes away from the experience."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
7,"After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight. I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later. I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife. daughters. and their friends kept repeating. &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks. this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?"
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
9,"These Coleman lanterns are incredible values.  I've had this model for 20 years or more.  As a kid. my family had a similar model that is still going strong.  There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics. no batteries.  They just work.  I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years. usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke.  At only a few dollars for two mantles. it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output.  On high. this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used.  As long as you get a new unit. you cannot go wrong with this lantern.  You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids."
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
3,"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise. this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself. I'd like to suggest the 'Burnt Orange Nation' blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings."
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
9,"This computer has been on my bike for almost 2.000 miles and it's still going strong. It seems to be very accurate. Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing  I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself. rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark. and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips. then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
10,"I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good. I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also. this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended."
2,"The vacuum is light weight. and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging. but it's designed for wall hanging. and it slides on the counter. and the shape is not made for flat surfaces."
7,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes. it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper."
5,"I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did. I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick. its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement. I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on."
10,"I have been through a bunch of these blades because they are cheap to buy. The blade is very thin. which is good for cutting drywall and paneling holes and such. The problem occurs when you need to cut any type of wood that isn't super thin. The blade gets HOT when cutting wood. The Blade is very thin. Guess what happens to an extremely hot and thin peice of metal? It warps.I have a collection of these blades with good teeth still on them that are warped like crazy.I understand that cutting with these multi-tools is a balance between speed and pressure. You don't want to go to fast or push to hard because that will create heat and chew through teeth. but you also don't want to cut too slow because that can also generate unwanted heat on the blade warping it and ruining the teeth. You don't want to push so hard you here the motor on your unit start to slow its pitch."
7,"I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible. then again it's brand new. and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple. once. too. I can see ordering a second 25' length. since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
9,"the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away..as for shooting with this i have not yet..also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56..well update this review after i take it shooting.11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great. but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well. It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver.I wish they made this exact scope in a 2-7 magnification."
10,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit.  It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!!  As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy. well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw.  It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so.  I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744.  If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
10,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice. neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising. it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience. but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
12,"The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color. The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games.  This time. Link doesn't have to save the world. but rather himself!  While Link is sailing on the ocean. his boat is struck by a lightning bolt. causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water. he lands on an island. But since he has landed on the island. all he can think of is getting off of it! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens.  This game has an excellent game play. and story-line! It is worth every penny!"
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
3,"This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,"The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff. frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand. but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware"
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
2,"One upon a time. many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well. time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work. I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home. I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!"
1,"I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them. but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars. and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!"
11,"I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures. so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However. for some reason. she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures. which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time. because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea. but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
9,"We own three of these little Victorinox Swiss Army Knives. two of them on our car key rings and another one for my son. This knife has a good collection of tools. including a very good pair of mini-scissors (really!). a nail file and small flat head screwdriver. tweezers. plastic toothpick. and knife.The knife blades were a little duller than I expected. but a few quick passes with my sharpenerAccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpenerput a very good edge on them.We also have several of the larger Victorinox knives as well (includingVictorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife) and have never been disappointed with any of their products.Highly Recommended!CFH"
6,"I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home (no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh). and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year!The satin finish melts into giftwrap. and gives an especially nice finish to my packages. 3/4' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges.  The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper. and holds well.  I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser. so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes. and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas. then birthdays. Mother and Father's Days. etc.  Another winner from the folks who do 'sticky' right."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
2,"Sturdy metal potato smasher. which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef. ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network. and once I learned this trick. it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also. we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense."
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
9,"I'm a pain to please..I work and go to school and study and a mother..OMG..omg..I have no time do nothing..I found time to workout on my weekends....and at first when I ordered I was over my head..so I got my man to fix it..The instructions we're bad..but he figured it out..I had this for 3yrs and I'm in good shape and workout 2 times a week for 60 mins..I do crossrunning and sking on the gazelle...its fun because it teaches me to balance myself and My waist used to be a 26 and now a 23...I'm very little now...But..I have been on a no carbs and no dairy diet..so that is why too.lol..the calorie counter that came with it did not work and it sucked..so I got a new one and replaced it."
3,"Read this book years ago and enjoyed it then. however. I enjoyed it even more reading it on my Kindle. What has inspired me about this book is the people in the book on the island are very different. yet come together to work together and survive. Yes. I know that there are lots of reviews on this book. however. what I want to say to you is that if you are looking for a book that will inspire you that you can survive anything. then read this book.And if read in a low time in your life. it will be meaningful to you to see the right answer. This is what I found that this book did for me. it helped me see what is important and what is not."
11,"It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it. I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game.  Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt.  I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the 'rules' no one was really engaged in the 'play' aspect.  I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an 'icebreaker'/conference setting.  There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work.  It was quite frankly. not that much fun.  As I mentioned previously. this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators. I belive that would make this game much more of a 'party'."
7,"An extremely well constructed feeder. easy for owner to fill. but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple. wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie"
3,"Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie. so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline. a plot. a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story. yes longer would have been better but. it wasn't just sex. I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story. fantastic!"
10,"If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and &#34;excellent&#34; joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt. you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer. eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put. these are the industry standard for a reason."
1,"Probably one of the world's best inventions. Vaseline.  But. this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus. it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby. the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!"
5,"I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine.PROS:  Non-oily. water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges. fingerprints. etc. and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free. fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes.CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area. so be careful to avoid spraying strings. pickups. etc.The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too.  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
7,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent. everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First. the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem. I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second. I grilled on it 2 days ago. on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks. should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."
12,"With The Minish Cap coming out soon. and looking to be another disappointment (I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it. but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe). the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic. The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer. The graphics aren't very good; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes. but the game is so good one will hardly notice. The sound effects are pretty poor. but. thankfully. there's always the music to compensate for that...and what good music.It feels like ALttP. looks like it. plays like it. and is second only to that excellent SNES game."
7,"This was a nice idea. but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder. the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it. because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table. which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers."
9,"This an excellent. inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work. but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility. is lightweight. accurate. and best of all. doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it. I can buy another one. and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate. which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive. and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good. decent quality. inexpensive compass."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
1,"It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack. but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid. I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone. these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages. Flexible Fabric. 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
3,"I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But. then again. I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant. sexy. strong. smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer."
11,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also. the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
12,"When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid. I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck. I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story. an interesting environment. and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion. it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game. don't consider any longer. GET IT."
2,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS!  It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT!  The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one.  Came here to Amazon. marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job. the parts are CHEAP!  The hose is not flexible. twists all the time. I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful. very stiff. very hard to wrap around the handle. and gets easily tangled in itself.  I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time. I'll get another brand."
5,"Bought this on a whim.  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion.  When used with a pedalboard rig. it doesn't add much except for hiss. unfortunately.  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit. though.  Does not sound good with updated equipment. Line 6 equipment. Roland units.  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head.  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal.  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar. amp. wah. and guitar. or amp. wah. guitar. and expression pedal.  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out. though.  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player. but good for beginners and intermediate levels.  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling."
10,"We have tried all types of blades. And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders! In 10' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight. we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 'Ultimate Crosscutting' blade! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours don't skimp on your crosscut blades! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud!And Fillet Your Wood!"
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
6,"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong. so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250' (6.3 m) long. so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price. the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."
2,"I have a philosophy that will not allow me to buy crummy tools. Tools for anything.... if they do not work or do not last. they are worthless. That's why I paid 14 bucks for a hand-operated can opener. Being an engineer I looked at the design and was impressed by the symmetrical (rather than cantilevered) hinge. I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers. That should last me my lifetime and leave 1 or 2 to bequeath to my survivors. Yes it is making me depart from my lifelong philosophy (and that makes me mad) but it is in self-defense. I am hungry and I CAN NOT OPEN ANY CANS."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
12,"For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated. this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play. although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too. in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and. in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or. indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission. or do the mission without support. as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs. and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book. and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care. but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!"
6,"For me. I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First. I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition. the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further. this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!"
2,"When this first arrived. I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt. but I've just used it for the first time. and the second it hit the rug. I could feel a surprising amount of power. And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do. by the way. and your hand goes on the inside of the cup. while the dirt is stuck to the outside. so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!I have a small one-bedroom apartment with very little storage space. and this tucks away easily behind the closet door.Well done. Eureka!"
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
5,"Bought one. tried it on a P-bass. loved it.  Returned to Amazon and bought an additional one for a Jazz Bass...love it.  Good product for a good price. very comfortable.  Update:  I just ordered my 3rd one of these. this time for another P-bass I picked up.  The only gripe I can think of (and it's being super picky) is as another review mentioned the strap's padding design doesn't really allow you to have your bass up in the way high position.  If you're a person who hangs your base under your chin you may have a problem with this strap. other than that. this is a killer product for a killer price."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
10,"I've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades.  I use them on my Ridgid 10' table saw. 10' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12' sliding miter saw. This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods.  I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades.  Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my 'best in class' award.  The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker.  To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website:  Life After 50--One Man's Perspective.  The link below will take you to my homepage where you'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL:  [...]"
6,"Sure. regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping. but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there. this is the tape for you. The best thing about this tape is that you virtually don't see it on most gift wrapping paper. The satin finish isn't too shiny or mattte. It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size. Now that I've used this tape. I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift. the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product!"
7,"I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can 'feel' the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils. hot lids. water pans. charcoals. wood. etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though. or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling. pulling. etc. these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on. soaping them up. and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us."
10,"Overall a great sander. I have dropped.stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way."
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
6,"I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could.  The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier.  This part stays behind on the sheet.  Unless I look real close. I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not.  If I used these all the time. I'm sure this would stop being an issue. as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing. these labels are great!  Easy to use. look amazing & professional thanks to being clear.  They stick really good.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended!"
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
5,"I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didn't have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So it's like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time. these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.It's a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!"
3,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel. since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read. and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers. but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
5,"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy. sharp almost. After playing a bit. the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually. it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice. you won't care."
12,"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all. the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store. buy it. You will have a good time with this game!"
12,"Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels.and don't forget our stars of the game.a brave.kicking butt little girl.Carrie.And a brave young whipping man.Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house.Dracula's castle.the forest.and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!"
6,"Sure. you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else.  If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software. and one that presents well to the recipient. then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry.  These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about.  I often reuse large envelopes. mailers. and boxes.  These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person.  They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
9,"We love these scooters!!  My kids are almost 4 and 5. and we all have one!!  This one was for my husband--my daughter insisted he should have one to ride with us!!  It didn't take any time at all for them to get the hang of riding them!  We bought therex kids theirs when we were at Virginia Beach for a week (3 and 4 at the time.) By the end of the week. they had it down pretty well!  We often take these for short trips instead of dragging the bicycles around!  They are compact. and a lot of fun!  Just wonderful!  I am also not a tiny person--I am 160 pounds. and my husband is 190. so they do a good job standing up to our weight!"
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"&quot;Breath of Fire 3&quot; is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good. and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character. and then later in the game. you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre."
12,"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made. Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too). its rich. colorful and very addicting. The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!). and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous. I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement. its just really cool. this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player. Im serious if you dont have this. your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!"
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
12,"This game is super hard the first time around. Then. when you beat it. and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour. because almost all of it is puzzles. so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights. where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest. funnest fight is in the very beggining. when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units. and better levels. this game would be worth buying. but as it is it is not all that good."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack.

6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
3,"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime. and like much of his later work. it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic. although more upbeat than. for example. _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall. but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can. or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views. more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout. but no more than that. and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read. at 630 kindle 'locations'."
3,"This short novella was in deed. a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot. scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites. yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
1,"The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners). and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing. but they simply get cleaner. More important. my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless. and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges. and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean. quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However. it's worth it for better dental and gum health."

12,"Ah. Spyro! Released in 1998 for the PS1. Spyro is the first entry of many. [Although. only the first three were any good. because the newer ones were owned by an poor company.]Graphics: 9/10: Horrible by today's standards. but very good by 1998 standards. Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10: Pretty catchy. nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound: 8/10: Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10: You control Spyro. the PO'd dragon. through many worlds. There he must collect gems. rescue dragons. fight enimies. bosses. and other dangers. and also use his trademark flame and charge moves. This game is a bit easy. but it's very entartaining.The game costs about 10$ about now. so buy it!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
5,"The mounting process was simple.Recommendation:  Buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don't already have one.  You don't want your instrument plummeting to the floor!I got a stud finder off Amazon and mounted two of these hangers.  They're holding up very well. The backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall.  Whether that's a good thing...is up to you.  I guess I don't have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped.  So maybe it is a good thing.Be careful when you hang it though.  It could definitely hit the wall if you don't place it on the hanger carefully."
5,"While the Nanowebs are coated and then coiled. the Polywebs are first coiled and then completely coated.  They both feel very. very smooth to play and the sound is amazing. I mean really amazing.  The Nano's sound is not quite as smooth and rich and heavy as the Poly's.  I would recommend trying both types for your electric guitars.  The Nanos may sound better for you on a hollow-body electric. and the Polys may sound better for you on a solid body electric; it's a personal preference like anything else.  The Polywebs though feel and are really smooth and give you a really fat. mellow. sweet sound."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
2,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs. and this knife does just that.  It has the nice 'good Grips' handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price. I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own. but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good. basic bread knife!"
2,"I can only give this a 3. Tools are to small-the motor has a w h i n e to it that drives me nuts! The motor also seems to get very hot--maybe I got a dud and just don't know it. The hoses are stiff-no flexibility at all. I do like a canister vacuum though as opposed to an upright-at least this one follows me around and doesn't knock me out when I pull it along. All in all it is an OK product but they could have done a much better job with the design--you must wrap the cord on the bottom for storage-not a useful feature at all--does it work ok? Sure it does. Should you buy it? Only if you don't mind all the above draw backs."
6,"They don't get jammed in the printer. the labels don't peel off unexpectedly. the sheets do not stick together. so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user. the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
12,"This game is great. You go through 5 different time portales. Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss. What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference. Oh! one more thing. press up. up. down. down. left. right. left. right. square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon.  This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation"
12,"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time."
9,"I got it at wally for $40.00 so the price was ok (discounted). I like the blade design. it was sharp out of the package. but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small. if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle. it is still a very good knife from a known brand. I will recommend it if the price is $40 or less and for  someone with smaller hands.Pros:sizeblade designCons:handleprice"
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
11,"This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time.  In addition to placing your workers. when you place them. an amount of time has to pass.  Once enough time has passed. one of your oldest generation of workers dies.  They're removed from the game. and depending on what job they were doing at the time. they're either placed into the history book of the village or they're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village. by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village. by traveling. and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book. or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It's a fairly tight worker placement game. with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
3,"I confess that I had read these before. many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects. romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime. daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
2,"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set. that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas. from Amazon.that work very well. I also bought the bench knife. and found a 16' cake lifter. and a 18' cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon. however. the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book. great starter outer! Oh yes. I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely.Super Chef David"
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
6,"These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers (front and back) at a time. The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them. I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels. They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed. I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels."
7,"this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill. with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it."
5,"After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more. I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way. if a longer unit is needed. I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware. very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front. using an SM 57. and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy."
12,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics. use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake."
12,"I have never managed to beat the game. can't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours.  My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation.  She was getting frustrated with Crash. until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play.  Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first. you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want.  Find the password screen and punch in: T(triangle).T.T.T.X.S(square).T.T.T.T.S.X.T.O.T.T.T.O.S.T.X.X.X.X. Maybe it is cheating. but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game. it makes playing it more fun!"
11,"Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other. The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused. It was sort of anticlimactic. It can take some time as you read each card (CAREFULLY) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds. And then suddenly the game is over. The second time we played things started to click and by the third game. we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it. Mind you. we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards. Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions. Reading carefully is crucial to this game. I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well."
12,"I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well. it was hard to locate where you were going. unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately. the writers expected us to know as well."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
11,"I'm not traditional. didn't grow up that way and have not lived that way...however. a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition.  So glad I did.  My daughter loves. Niko (that's what we named our elf) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night.  Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night.  We love it and so glad we purchased it.  When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email.  It's really very cute and creative.  The included book explains the story and tradition.  Great find. and I recommend!"
10,"I am a weekend woodwarrior.  Wanted a nice sliding miter saw.  Looked at all of them. fondled a few and them. then found this one on sale through Amazon.  This is a nice saw.  Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day.  Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square.  Adjustments were quick and easy. Very easy to use.  Manual is great. Dust collection is not that great. but it wasn't with my non-sliding miter either.  It's the nature of this type of machine.  What was my old miter saw?  A Bosch 12' that was stolen from my garage.  Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff.  Would buy this one again in a heart beat."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
9,"This is a fairly nice basketball.plenty of tact creates a good grip and the size seems to work well for all of us. As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball  overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price.  I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!"
2,"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry). we did not have 'proof of purchase' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer 'service' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."
11,"I'm a mother. trainer. and in-home childcare provider. so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success.  I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another 'homework' book to do.  I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they're presented; the price is great. too.  For $2. it's worth it.For all of my kids. I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool (or Kindergarten. 1st grade. etc.. depending on their age).  It's only $13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level.  I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare's Writing Center."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
1,"I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page. it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews. many buyers received their batteries unpackaged. just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago. I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are. but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time."
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
12,"When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end. doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore. But with the recent purchase of a n64. i have again. found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful. fun cheats that it offers. This game changed the way we play games. totally. It is still one of the best games I own. right next to the newest xbox 360 games."
3,"When I first started reading this romance. the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona. because as I read further and learned more about him. he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde. which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale. the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse. so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that."
10,"I just finished a very long session with the Makita: more than 250 hard maple planks that I'm milling into flooring. I'm very satisfied. The saw is very well designed. the action is smooth. and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box. I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch (non-sliding). With the non-sliding saw. I'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw. With the Makita. I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks. no table saw necessary. The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to. but once you've used it awhile. you get the hang of it. My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor (how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch)."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
11,"I'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D&D board game that was a non cooperative game. It was fun. This game was so much more fun because we were all working together. It was hard. We barely completed the quest. My character had to be healed. another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown. A few more turns and we would have lost. That was the easiest one. I do admit we made a few mistakes. I played the solo a few times and either didn't make it or barely made it. This is definitely a challenging game. The game itself is very well made and durable. This is definitely a five star game."
1,"This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days. maybe weeks. with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades. not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price."
9,"many angles to throw.Can throw like frisbee and it will go straight for a long time but you have to throw it more precisely than a regular frisbee.also like a boomerang which will come back in a big circlebut my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love thesebut they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight."
9,"This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars. so we were happy. we now have two little boats (and yes. one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up. but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air. so that boasts well for the quality."
6,"These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years.  I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so. as far I'm concerned. the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick.  They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer. once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer.  That's a change from all the HP printers I've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery's Design Pro software.  Once I figured it out. the labels and the software are just what I needed."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a 'I have to type from a textbook onto my computer' kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot. for learning to type and it holding the book open. for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you. things like that."
6,"As others have stated here. a label is a label is a label...right?  Not always.  There are many factors that I look at when buying labels. especially in quantity:1.  Price.  Big variances between 'generic' and 3M. Avery. etc.2.  Glue.  Good glue won't come through the label.3.  Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter). and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove. the label can be easily torn.  Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value. and have the other characteristics of good labels.  Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product (even at a much lower price) I buy the Avery."
2,"The handle sure is comfortable. just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber. it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip. the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid. non-damaging material."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
1,"I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times. that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients. etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
7,"I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away. now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine. and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains. but other than that. this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging. but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs. but I have never really noticed any smell from using this."
10,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708. the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction. particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece. but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides. removing for steep beveling. etc)."
9,"Got it on sale a month ago! Upon first arrival i thought the valve was blocked but it was actually a pinch and inflate valve. So like some other reviewers i punctured the valve opening a tad more to be able to blow air faster into this thing. So far so good a 4d Battery pump will blow this up fast. But I opt to save the weight and blow this thing up by mouth taking 3-5 breath breaks inbetween. For the price it's a much better alternative and far more rugged then the photos do it justice. Don't waste money on a big agnes or any expensive brand enless you NEED a pad thats 1 pounds or lighter. This will suffice for the extra pound or two it is compared to a minimalist pad. hope this review helps some people and helps you pull the trigger. No problems with loss of air. A truely amazing deal."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
6,"My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design. feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound.  No static. no distortion. no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever. it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place.  I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed. If you want a solid. basic phone without bells and whistles. buy this one.  Actually. it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers (a feature I used successfully) so it does have some bells and whistles."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
1,"When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They. by far. have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much. I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time. I think I'll get two :)"
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
10,"If you own Unisaw. or any other large heavy machine for that matter. you really should consider getting a mobile base.  Delta's bases are strong. sturdy. look good and are very stable.  When I upgraded to a Unisaw. I also  bought the mobile base.  My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than  my contractors saw used to be.  With a quick step on the foot lever it  effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved  very easily.  A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the  saw and it rests solidly on 4 points. making it very stable.  This design  of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and  manouver.  If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was. put your  machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less  space and your shop will seem larger."
6,"This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use (no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer. but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed).  Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions. using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software.  Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope.  This way you can design your own personalized return address labels.  My only suggestion for improving Avery's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels."
1,"This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."
12,"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game. Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said. I liked the characters. Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun: Single-Player: C+ Multi-player: B+Sound: B-Characters: B+Controls: A-Overall: B"
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced. yes. but you get Darth Vader as a pilot. and he is worth every point.  The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader. and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader (TIE Advanced) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
2,"I had used an old ice cream maker for years. but got tired of the ice and salt mess. so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews. I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok. especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well. let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold. it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency. but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!"
11,"This game is pretty fun for young children. in fact we did play it three times when we first opened it. However. it can be very hard to win the key is to get a high roll. If you ae unlucky like I was to roll low number you are out of luck a lot on this game. It is also hard to move all the way over to the other side of the board so that you can try the other 'mini games' there were a couple that seemed really fun but I never got to try them because my piece started way over on one side and they were on the other. I like the concept and who doesn't love Rudolph but I really think they could have made it a much more fun game."
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
5,"I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great. but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people. but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"
3,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels. but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas. she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy. they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one. I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen. cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
5,"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires. of course. the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them. I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
10,"Milwaukee. again. has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters. although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters."
5,"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence. it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings. redesign the mount. say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen."
12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
3,"Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me. the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story. unfortunately. suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine. but it's just not developed in this one."
3,"I loved curling up with this over the Holidays. Belle and Rafe are so cute together. They are a believable couple with all the family 'drama' wrapped up in the story. It had great character development. I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle. We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family 'first' when we were starting out in our careers. Where was Rafe when I needed him?!?!? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture. especially around the holidays. I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books. Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea. your favorite quilt. and curl up with this book. you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips. that peel and bleed.  Chapstick. Carmex. etc...  work for me. but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So. I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST. and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product. I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands. not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful."
11,"I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative 'deck-building' mechanic of that game.  I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone.  I usually don't buy games unless I've played them before so I know what to expect. but I decided to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did!  Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme.  The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent.  The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion. but it makes for a more involved experience.  I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard. Recommended!"
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
12,"Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example. you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself. although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in. like 40 Lines. on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top. Marathon. on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top. or Ultra. where you see how good you can do. except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped."
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
3,"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers. for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports. life. and all the world news. Great paper!!"
5,"At first I thought this would be a gimmick. but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it. however. I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live. I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though. I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant. white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
10,"My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result. puts his power tools through hell.  He's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s.  It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita.  I've never been sorry.  I'm not a pro. but I certainly enjoy having a powerful. accurate saw when I need to make home repairs.  I haven't found anything I can't slice through with this little monster.  I've had it several years and it works like a new tool.  The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard. thick lumber and has the added homeowner's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws.  There's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever."
6,"I have had negative experiences with 'generic' printable labels in the past...specifically. with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version. which work equally well.  However. for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website. there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."
5,"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal 'open' to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix. Classic. and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way"
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
12,"For all gamers out there. this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan"
12,"I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out. some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system. I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier. this is an early title for the N64. you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games. ignore it if your looking for the best."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
10,"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits. but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2' size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table. this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4' collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly. of course. and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers. in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers. you need one for backup in any case"
10,"Great sander. ample power. belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap.  However. one time during use. I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up. wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing. and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired. but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord. and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that. the tool has performed flawlessly."
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time. but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64. and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said. this is one of the most innovative. most fun. and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE. there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game. and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100"
5,"But unless you are new to guitar. you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really. I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great. and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future. I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal. if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said."
5,"If you're buying this and new to effects pedals (like I was). you'll be concerned whether it'll work with the inexpensive pedals you're likely to also be buying. especially since there is a large kit with a number of converters that might scare you into thinking you'll need them. The two most common types of inexpensive pedals are Danelectro and Behringer. and if you're like me they're ll you'll buy for quite a while. The good news is. you do NOT need to buy converters for them. This little beauty will run all your Behringer and Danelectro pedals. off from any of the standard 9V power supplies available (you don't NEED to buy a 1SPOT. I use it with a Behringer but you could certainly put it together with the less-expensive Planet Wave if you're working on an even tighter budget. In short. buy this product. it will save you its cost in 9V batteries within the first two months if you're on low-price pedals."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
9,"I have bought these at Target. Walmart. Amazon. and probably other places - I've bought so many I can't remember.  My last several have been from Amazon and have been very happy with the service.All I need is a little pen knife and I appreciate the size and the tools that are included.  I sharpen the blade when it gets dull and eventually I replace the whole knife when I lose it (like happened the last time) or just starts looking too worn out from being in my pocket with my keys. etc.I expect that I'll keep buying them for the rest of my life."
3,"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck. Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome. a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4"
12,"Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot. the comedy. the political intrigues. an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was. whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again. you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew. think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell. this game's for you!"
10,"I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with 'drill'. Like . you look in the dictionary for 'Drill' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong. unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly. this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong. Be carefull."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
1,"I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that)."
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason. he thought. but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
6,"If you have something such as a poster. sign. or brochure holder that you'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong (recommended for holding up to 2 lbs). This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall. If you'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just don't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you'll need to clean or scrape off. Also. there's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape."
10,"When I put this blade on my old skil saw. I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me. If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all. try switching to this blade and see how it should be done! I've been cutting some 1/4&quot; oak finish beaded paneling and I don't even have to turn it face down. My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up. Not this blade. I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went. Not a mark to be seen. Great blade!"
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
2,"I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing. and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus. it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
6,"I can't get over just how 'real' these cards look. even when using a standard inkjet printer. There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge. and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you're looking for an 'executive' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery's own 'DesignPro' program (free--and idiot-proof). which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price. you don't always need 200 cards and you can't always wait. For instance. if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days. it's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can't recommend these highly enough."
2,"I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash. but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes. turnips. carrots. etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition. but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area. most stores carry only the swivel version."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
5,"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops. and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past. on friends' guitars. semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast. these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still. the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes. making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch. using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system. and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar."
2,"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big. the lid goes on real smooth. the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go. when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move. lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
7,"I caught over 18 rabbits. 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
10,"This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are."
11,"I am not big into playing games. but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand. I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic. You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box. no complicated instructions. It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults (all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it). The games only take about 20 minutes so it isn't a big time commitment either. To me it's like a dominoes/Uno combo. but more fun and more variety of play. Very fun. excellent game. not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews."
5,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins."
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
12,"Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system. the Playstation. Still. I have never grown tired of playing levels. which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack. the jungle is incredibly lush. and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder."
12,"What's amazing about how great this game is...well. it's that it does not rely on insane graphics. large amounts of memory. lightning-quick processing speeds. or mind-blowing sound.In fact. this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin. suck you in. and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2. etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one."
11,"Bananagrams is a brilliant game. It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble (the interminable length of some games or turns!) by making speed an issue. You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids (older for sure) to play as well. We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family. Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one. If you are at all interested in word games. you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round. So simple! Perfect. get it! Wish I had thought of it..."
1,"These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not. so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly. then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system."
7,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then. when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry. NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
2,"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar. but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said. you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir. and then take the freezer bowl out. cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great. I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
2,"As with all OXO Good Grips products. the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade. however. is less than 2 inches long. making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes. though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating. rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short. this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."
2,"Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements. We're pretty old. so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook. and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years. and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
6,"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions. I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket. I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters. and run them forward and reverse.  So far. my latest shredder is running smooth as silk. with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good. no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way."
12,"This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use. even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse. U have to be in direct light to see the screen. and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter."
9,"I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes. you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me. so I went with this model to get the serrated blade. and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned. buttery smooth. nicer than my Leatherman Rebar. and yes. bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside. and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool. I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler. inches/centimeters. is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel."
9,"I grew up with Dr. Bronner's Soap. Dr. Bronner's doesn't advertise. they don't need to. Not with the word of mouth they get from an growing number of fans and almost all of them will tell you. this is the good stuff.The label is fantastic of course. The soap is very refreshing. Unlike other reviewers I don't recommend it for shampoo though. I have hip length very straight hair and Dr. Bronner's makes my hair look dirty unless I follow it up with a vinegar rinse. and cold vinegar on a peppermint-y head while being very bracing isn't my favorite way to wake up.Other than that though. I've used this for laundry and for washing myself with and love the tingle.My husband was an Irish Spring user until I got him to try this. He exfoliates with a scrubbie and Dr. Bronner's and tingly clean has become his standard for clean. The scent is fantastic if you like peppermint."
2,"Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler. It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want. I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives. I like peeling potatoes. apples. and carrots.  Sometimes. I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.  This peeler is ergonomically comfortable. I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands. (I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either. I just rinse and wipe. along the grain. using a sponge. That does the trick.  I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.  It is rust free as the day I bought it.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I am recommending it to you."
5,"What can I say. they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still. after all of these years and innovations in strings. Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!"
6,"This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.  I also have a TI-84 and a Voyage 200. both of which I love.  I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.  I didn't have a lot of money to spend. so this one seemed to fit the bill.  I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones. though.  It has all the functions I want. including storing the previous answer. but the buttons don't always register a key press.  It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental.  It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register.  It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press. either.  The button presses just don't get picked up some times."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point. biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use. though. and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time. and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool. and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly. in fact. that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible. and the port stays clear."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
1,"I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing."
6,"These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail. but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy. took printer ink well. and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle."
5,"I do all my own guitar maintenance. which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings. etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose. but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So. looking around on Amazon. I found this handy little device.  It's small. works well. and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong. it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it."
12,"Like I've said before. Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996. the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays. every other game is a 3d adventure 'in the vain of Tomb Raider'.The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action. great graphics which still hold up today. and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending. and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?While TR 2 is the best in the series. this one will be the most remembered.Story: 6/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Fun: 8/10"
5,"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats. and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality. since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10'. 1/4' mono (tip)"
1,"Excellent product but a little pricy. relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver. then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver. to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades. unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!"
1,"The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more. the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store. and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change)."
4,"To anyone who. like me. only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death. this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program. giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here. all the banter between  songs. the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent. two seperate sound  mixes. regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
5,"Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty.I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement...no problems whatsoever.For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable. good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends.Not the best. but not the worst. Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording.I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables.They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where. cable owner. etc.Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a 'feel good' purchase.I would recommend these cables and will buy again."
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
2,"Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so. then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH. if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate. then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm."
6,"This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well. is less likely than many to tangle. and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays. and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters. not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle. make wrapping a chore. Well. this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure. but it does make it easy and quick. with a lovely professional appearance."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
1,"You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like. but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless. these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries. let's just give this power-packing. very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!"
11,"Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up. I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking. which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things. but accuracy is key. which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring. can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!"
10,"The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job. it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much. do more. and not be annoyed by that aweful motor."
5,"Listen.If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability. buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work. in case the guys called for a practice session. so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other. way more expensive guitars. like a Gibson ES-335. Dean 12 string. and a Fender Strat. but I gotta tell you. I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up. so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes. just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it."
5,"First time I ordered these was in a larger order. and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you. Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately. so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze. but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these. and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone. and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time."
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
10,"This sander is very high quaility. and will last for years. It is very powerful. you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander. because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great. it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable. ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust. just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander."
9,"I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However. I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two. except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's. and are stronger. the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars."
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
12,"Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet. but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man. Dig-Dug. Galaxian. Phozon. and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun. but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall. I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
10,"I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem. I had very poor results.  Using solid wood. however. resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product."
7,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight. but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great. but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work. but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
5,"Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right. but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high. it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs. so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00"
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
1,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well. after just taking it for two days. i had a terrible reaction to it. felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level. so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill. but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
5,"I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition."
10,"You'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago. I use this saw every day. I cut and/or cut and cope large base. large case. and large crown even 16&quot; bullnose shelving on custom homes. I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut. still dead on. I even straight cut cope joints. and the blade follows the bevel perfectly. In some houses the preference is Oak. and the cuts are knifejoint. Everyone I work with has one. swears by them. Just as good as the day I got it. It is not stationary either. it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer. I couldn't begin to count. even in a day. how many times the base has swiveled. rails have slid. bevel has been changed. and the saw has started.and it's just as accurate as the day I got it. I make my living with this saw. I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed."
9,"I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones. I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives."
1,"I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent. fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time. retain power even when they're just sitting not being used. and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls. Wii remotes. toys. etc.)."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
11,"We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash.  The quality of this book is fantastic.  It has a very heavy. sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different. fun scenery. which makes it visually appealing even when there aren't a ton of stickers on that particular page.  My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book. and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection.  I can foresee this lasting until she's pretty much bored with collecting stickers. and that's a couple years down the road."
10,"I own a home remodeling business. and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as 'chop' saws for rough framing duties; however. when I need to do finish work or flooring. I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid. durable and very accurate. and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure. 10'. 12' and 15' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings. but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility. portability. and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"
11,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around. add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality. stickers can be pulled off. moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift. party favor and holiday present."
1,"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use. they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not 'Great for the environment' if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
5,"Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy. sealed looking fretboard. that doesn't have that problem. but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's. but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
4,"This was one of the first Godzilla movies I saw as a kid and to this this day it's my number one favorite Godzilla movie. Plenty of monsters in this flick you get the return of Rodan.plus you get to watch Godzilla and Rodan go at it and then you get to watch Godzilla;Rodan. and Mothra team up and fight King Ghidorah the baddest of the villians in the Godzilla series. The story line was really good in this Godzilla flick as well it had a James Bond twist for human drama in this film which kept it interesting. The monsters got plenty of screen time on this flick which made it even better and this is one of the few Godzilla films that don't involve space ailens controlling the monsters as well. In this one you actually get to see the monsters be monsters. The special effects in this film were good especially when Ghidorah starts destroying the city and the monster battles were awesome in this one as well. I would definetly recommend this one to any Godzilla fan out there."
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
4,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done. is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books. I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies. true to the Bible."
2,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker. purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap. it not only does not do the job. the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker. that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
8,"Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know. you'd be like all dogs love food. but mine is different. He eats mostly meat. and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half. and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food. and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull. 67-68 pounds average."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
5,"Yes. these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics. but no more. I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do. however. seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it."
4,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do. too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs. all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie. his friends. and Elmo. as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy. and I highly recommend it!"
8,"I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all. never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note. that if you have cats. there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows. so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets."
8,"I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes. etc."
4,"Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest. I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another. and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here. hence the controvery surrounding the film).Just shocking the way Jesus was treated."
4,"Mel Gibson's film of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus focuses on his torture and crucifixion.  There is little dialogue. and it mostly consists of passages from the Bible.  The spoken Aramaic and English subtitles were not distracting. as the story is so familiar.  The brutality is unrelenting. but it was realistic.This movie is not for everyone.  It is not 'entertaining.'  Those who liked the old movies 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' and 'King of Kings'  will not be surprised by anything here (only the degree to which the torture is shown). because it is the same story.  It is an intimate. in-your-face. almost real-time reenactment of the crucifixion.  Due to the very personal and intense reaction people have to the movie. I think it would have been better shown in churches than in the theatre."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
8,"These receptacles offer poor value for the money. and are constructed of very cheap. flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste. but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors. and with the lack of a tight fit. the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support."
8,"My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago. both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool. moving water).  Yes. it accumlates fur. but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes). everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together. sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
2,"I wore out my original one. so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads. and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad. I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor. and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you. and I like small pieces of carrot in salads. not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces. dressing. and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one. except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
11,"I have loved all the D&D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far (I have the other two already) and this one was no exception.  Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you &#34;get it&#34; you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games. but that was it.  If you loved old school D&D but wished it was a bit more tactile (you know. game pieces and stuff) as opposed to all pencil and paper &#34;in your head&#34; like I did. then you will LOVE this!"
4,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product. I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further. ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio. but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed. it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola. I wouldn't have bought this doorstop. and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead."
2,"I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum.  I hate this vacuum and here is why:  It's CHEAP cheap cheap plastic. cheap plastic hose that leaks air thus decreasing suction.  The suction is miserable even when the hose is not leaking air.  The body is cheap plastic.  The unit is difficult to manuever. the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog. 2 cats. a baby. hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.  I bought this to replace an old euro-pro vacuum that I had for 10 years that worked beautifully.  I am saving up for a miele canister vacuum to replace this piece of crap."
12,"I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure. thriller. problem solving. and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours. but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game."
12,"This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good. and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before. and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me. you will get your money's worth! Good graphics. excellent sound scores. huge worlds. and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority. even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through. and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand."
2,"I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.  I have only had this brush a few days. but find myself using it constantly.  It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal. cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood. and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices.  The brush can be put in the dishwasher. or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes. This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.  It is definitely a good value for the price."
8,"Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this. darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing"
11,"This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme.  This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination.  For avid fans of the Simpsons. the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character (even the obscure ones) to get the answer right.  The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together.  If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans. you won't be disappointed buying this."
8,"'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure. you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline'. but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers. on several occasions. that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs. as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues. and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back). my dog stopped scratching. and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!"
8,"I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it. I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever. and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff. and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed. however. is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus). his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks. however. his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
12,"This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game. i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube. so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game."
1,"I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though. buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
10,"I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact. it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400."
8,"Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange. fungal infection. abuse. no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement. but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it."
12,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics.better realism. and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good. after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
12,"When the day I got unreal and tried it. I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was. the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game. you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):VortexRikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali. then all goes wrong!your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj. you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel. you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real. no it's not. it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating. breath taking missions. where you fight for life to survive. collecting itemslike defenses and weapons. travel through temples. facilitys. castles. bases. mountians. journey through what napali has to offer. and end up and the skaarj mothers ship. confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone!I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!"
6,"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad. I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality. sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the 'click' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."
2,"Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss. and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.  I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.  Great quality. expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.  BUT.  This thing is giant!  Do you know how big four inches is?  I may just be really dumb but I've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use.  It looks like something you'd use in home defense.  Who needs a pot when you've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing? Seriously. I didn't know I'd have to lock it away from the children. but I really don't think it's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest.  It works great. though.  I guess it's for serious pizza eaters."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration. thinking. and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair. fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board. the style of the cards. and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!"
4,"&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all.but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better. that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge. even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
